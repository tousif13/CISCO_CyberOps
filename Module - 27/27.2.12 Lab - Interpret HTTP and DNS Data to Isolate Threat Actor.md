# 27.2.12 Lab - Interpret HTTP and DNS Data to Isolate Threat Actor

> MySQL is a popular database used by numerous web applications. Unfortunately, SQL injection is a common 
web hacking technique. It is a code injection technique where an attacker executes malicious SQL statements 
to control a web application's database server.

Domain name servers (DNS) are directories of domain names, and they translate the domain names into IP 
addresses. This service can be used to exfiltrate data. 

Cybersecurity personnel have determined that an exploit has occurred, and data containing PII may have 
been exposed to threat actors. In this lab, you will use Kibana to investigate the exploits to determine the data 
that was exfiltrated using HTTP and DNS during the attacks.
