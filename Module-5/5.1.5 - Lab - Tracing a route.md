# 5.1.5 Lab - Tracing a route

> The traceroute (or tracert) tool is often used for network troubleshooting. By showing a list of routers
traversed, it allows the user to identify the path taken to reach a particular destination on the network or
across internetworks. Each router represents a point where one network connects to another network and
through which the data packet was forwarded. The number of routers is known as the number of "hops" the
data traveled from source to destination.

`tracert` for Windows and `traceroute` for Unix command is used.

## Step 1: Verifying Network Connectivity Using Ping

* Start the CyberOps Workstation VM. Log into the VM with the following credentials:

      Username: analyst
      Password: cyberops
* Open a terminal window in the VM to ping a remote server, such as `www.cisco.com.`

* The first output line displays the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) e2867.dsca.akamaiedge.net. This
is followed by the IP address 184.24.123.103. Cisco hosts the same web content on different servers
throughout the world (known as mirrors). Therefore, depending upon where you are geographically, the
FQDN and the IP address will be different.

## Step 2: Tracing a Route to a Remote Server Using Traceroute

>  CyberOps Workstation VM network settings may need to be set to bridged adapter if you are not
getting any traceroute results. To check your network settings, go to: Machine > Settings, select Network,
the tab Adapter 1, Attached to: Bridged Adapter.



* If you would like to save the traceroute output to a text file for later review, use the right carat (>) and the
desired filename to save the output in the present directory. In this example, the traceroute output is
saved in the /home/analyst/cisco-traceroute.txt file.
