# 27.1.5 Lab - Convert Data into a Universal Forma

## Part 1: Normalize Timestamps in a Log File

* Launch the CyberOps Workstation VM and then launch a terminal window
* Use the cd command to change to the /home/analyst/lab.support.files/ directory. A copy of the file shown above is stored there

* Issue the following AWK command to convert and print the result on the terminal:
* `awk 'BEGIN {FS=OFS="|"}{$3=strftime("%c",$3)} {print}' applicationX_in_epoch.log`

    awk – This invokes the AWK interpreter.
    ‘BEGIN – This defines the beginning of the script.
    {} – This defines actions to be taken in each line of the input text file. An AWK script can have several actions.
    FS = OFS = “|” – This defines the field separator (i.e., delimiter) as the bar (|) symbol. Different text files may use different delimiting characters to separate fields. This operator allows the user to define what character is used as the field separator in the current text file.
    $3 – This refers to the value in the third column of the current line. In the applicationX_in_epoch.log, the third column contains the timestamp in epoch to be converted.
    strftime - This is an AWK internal function designed to work with time. The %c and $3 in between parenthesis are the parameters passed to strftime.
    applicationX_in_epoch.log – This is the input text file to be loaded and used. Because you are already in the lab.support.files directory, you do not need to add path information, /home/analyst/lab.support.files/applicationX_in_epoch.log.

* Were the Unix Epoch timestamps converted to Human Readable format? Were the other fields modified? Explain.

      Yes, the unix epoch timestamps converted to human readable format and other fields are not modified as above command modifies only timestamps.

* Compare the contents of the file and the printed output. Why is there the line, ||Wed 31 Dec 1969 07:00:00 PM EST?

      The reason for the extra line is because the file has an empty line at the end, which led the script to mistakenly interpret it as 0 and convert that into a Human Readable timestamp.

* Use nano (or your favorite text editor) to remove the extra empty line at the end of the file and run the AWK script again by using the up-arrow to find it in the command history buffer.

* Is the output correct now? Explain

      Yes, as last line is removed. Now the output is correct.

* While printing the result on the screen is useful for troubleshooting the script, analysts will likely need to save the output in a text file. Redirect the output of the script above to a file named `applicationX_in_human.log` to save it to a file:

* What was printed by the command above? Is this expected?

        Nothing printed. Output redirected to the given file.

* Use `cat` to view the applicationX_in_human.log. Notice that the extra line is now removed and the timestamps for the log entries have been converted to human readable format.

## Part 2: Normalize Timestamps in an Apache Log File

* Similar to what was done with the applicationX_in_epoch.log file, Apache web server log files can also be normalized. Follow the steps below to convert Unix Epoch to Human Readable timestamps. Consider the following Apache log file, apache_in_epoch.log:

* As in Part 1, a script will be created to convert the timestamp from Epoch to Human Readable.
* In the context of timestamp conversion, what character would work as a good delimiter character for the Apache log file above?

        Space character

* How many columns does the Apache log file above contain?

          7

* In the Apache log file above, what column contains the Unix Epoch Timestamp?

          Column 4

* In the CyberOps Workstation VM terminal, a copy of the Apache log file, apache_in_epoch.log, is stored in the /home/analyst/lab.support.files.
* Use an awk script to convert the timestamp field to a human readable format. Notice that the command contains the same script used previously, but with a few adjustments for the delimiter, timestamp field,and file name.

* Was the script able to properly convert the timestamps? Describe the output

          No. All timestamps are displayed as Wed 31 Dec 1969 07:00:00 PM EST.

* Before moving forward, think about the output of the script.
* Can you guess what caused the incorrect output? Is the script incorrect? What are the relevant differences between the applicationX_in_epoch.log and apache_in_epoch.log?

          Because of '[' character, the script can't convert [ as a timestamp. Thus assuming it as zero it displays incorrect output.

* To fix the problem, the square brackets must be removed from the timestamp field before the conversion takes place. Adjust the script by adding two actions before the conversion, as shown below:
* `awk 'BEGIN {FS=OFS=" "}{gsub(/\[|\]/,"",$4)}{print}{$4=strftime("%c",$4)}{print}' apache_in_epoch.log`

* Notice after specifying space as the delimiter with `{FS=OFS=” “}`, there is a regular expression action to match and replace the square brackets with an empty string, effectively removing the square brackets that appear in the timestamp field. The second action prints the updated line so the conversion action can be performed
* In a CyberOps Workstation VM terminal, execute the adjusted script, as follows:

* Was the script able to properly convert the timestamps this time? Describe the output.

          Yes. The output now displays two lines for each log entry. The first line displays using Human Readable format and the second line is the same log entry with the timestamp displaye the Unix Epoch format

* Shut down CyberOps Workstation VM if desired
