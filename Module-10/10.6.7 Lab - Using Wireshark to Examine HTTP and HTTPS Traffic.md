# 10.6.7 Lab - Using Wireshark to Examine HTTP and HTTPS Traffic

## Part 1: Capture and View HTTP Traffic

* In this part, you will use tcpdump to capture the content of HTTP traffic. You will use command options to save the traffic to a packet capture (pcap) file. These records can then be analyzed using different applications that read pcap files, including Wireshark.

### Step 1: Start the virtual machine and log in

* Start the CyberOps Workstation VM. Use the following user credentials:
          
      Username: analyst
      Password: cyberops

### Step 2: Open a terminal and start tcpdump

* Open a terminal application and enter the command `ip address`
* List the interfaces and their IP addresses displayed in the ip address output.

* While in the terminal application, enter the command `sudo tcpdump –i enp0s3 –s 0 –w httpdump.pcap`. Enter the password cyberops for the user analyst when prompted

* This command starts tcpdump and records network traffic on the `enp0s3` interface.
* The `-i` command option allows you to specify the interface. If not specified, the tcpdump will capture all traffic on all interfaces.
* The `-s` command option specifies the length of the snapshot for each packet. You should limit snaplen to the smallest number that will capture the protocol information in which you are interested. Setting snaplen to 0 sets it to the default of 262144, for backwards compatibility with recent older versions of tcpdump.
* The `-w` command option is used to write the result of the tcpdump command to a file. Adding the extension .pcap ensures that operating systems and applications will be able to read to file. All recorded traffic will be printed to the file httpdump.pcap in the home directory of the user analyst
* Open a web browser from the launch bar within the CyberOps Workstation VM. Navigate to 
http://www.altoromutual.com/login.jsp
* Because this website uses HTTP, the traffic is not encrypted. Click the Password field to see the warning pop up.
* Enter a username of `Admin` with a password of `Admin` and click Login.
* Close the web browser.
* Return to the terminal window where tcpdump is running. Enter CTRL+C to stop the packet capture.

### Step 3: View the HTTP capture

* The tcpdump, executed in the previous step, printed the output to a file named httpdump.pcap. This file is located in the home directory for the user `analyst`.
* Click the File Manager icon on the desktop and browse to the home folder for the user `analyst`. Double click the `httpdump.pcap` file, in the Open With dialog box scroll down to Wireshark and then click `Open`
* In the Wireshark application, filter for `http` and click Apply

* Browse through the different HTTP messages and select the `POST` message
* In the lower window, the message is displayed. Expand the `HTML Form URL Encoded: application/xwww-form-urlencoded` section.

* What two pieces of information are displayed?

      uid & passwd

* Close the Wireshark application.

## Part 2: Capture and View HTTPS Traffic

* You will now use tcpdump from the command line of a Linux workstation to capture HTTPS traffic. After starting tcpdump, you will generate HTTPS traffic while tcpdump records the contents of the network traffic. These records will again be analyzed using Wireshark

### Step 1: Start tcpdump within a terminal.

* While in the terminal application, enter the command `sudo tcpdump –i enp0s3 –s 0 –w 
httpsdump.pcap`. Enter the password cyberops for the user analyst when prompted.

* This command will start tcpdump and record network traffic on the enp0s3 interface of the Linux workstation. If your interface is different than enp0s3, please modify it when using the above command.
* All recorded traffic will be printed to the file `httpsdump.pcap` in the home directory of the user analyst
* Open a web browser from the launch bar within the CyberOps Workstation VM. Navigate to 
`www.netacad.com`

* What do you notice about the website URL?

      The protocol used in this website is https which adds security layer that doesn't reveal any credentials through capturing the traffic.

* Click Log in.
* Enter in your NetAcad username and password. Click Next
* Close the web browser in the VM
* Return to the terminal window where tcpdump is running. Enter CTRL+C to stop the packet capture

### Step 2: View the HTTPS capture
