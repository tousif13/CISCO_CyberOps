# 28.4.13 Lab - Incident Handling

> Computer security incident response has become a vital part of any organization. The process for handling a 
security incident can be complicated and involve many different groups. An organization must have standards 
for responding to incidents in the form of policies, procedures, and checklists. To properly respond to a 
security incident, the security analyst must be trained to understand what to do and must also follow all of the 
guidelines outlined by the organization. There are many resources available to help organizations create and 
maintain a computer incident response handling policy. The NIST Special Publication 800-61r2 is specifically 
cited in the Understanding Cisco Cybersecurity Operations Fundamentals (200-201 CBROPS) exam topics.

## Scenario 1: Worm and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Agent Infestation

* Study the following scenario and discuss and determine the incident response handling questions that should be asked at each stage of the incident response process. Consider the details of the organization and the CSIRC when formulating your questions

> This scenario is about a small, family-owned investment firm. The organization has only one location and less 
than 100 employees. On a Tuesday morning, a new worm is released; it spreads itself through removable 
media, and it can copy itself to open Windows shares. When the worm infects a host, it installs a DDoS agent. 
It was several hours after the worm started to spread before antivirus signatures became available. The
organization had already incurred widespread infections.
The investment firm has hired a small team of security experts who often use the diamond model of security 
incident handling.
