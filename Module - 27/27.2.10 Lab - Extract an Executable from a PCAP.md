# 27.2.10 Lab - Extract an Executable from a PCAP

## Part 1: Analyze Pre-Captured Logs and Traffic Captures

* In Part 2, you will work with the `nimda.download.pcap` file. Captured in a previous lab, nimda.download.pcap contains the packets related to the download of the Nimda malware. Your version of 
the file, if you created it in the previous lab and did not reimport your CyberOps Workstation VM, is stored in the /home/analyst directory. However, a copy of that file is also stored in the CyberOps Workstation VM, 
under the `/home/analyst/lab.support.files/pcaps` directory so that you can complete this lab. For consistency of output, the lab will use the stored version in the pcaps directory
* While `tcpdump` can be used to analyze captured files, Wireshark’s graphical interface makes the task much easier. It is also important to note that tcpdump and Wireshark share the same file format for packet 
captures; therefore, PCAP files created by one tool can be opened by the other.
* Change directory to the lab.support.files/pcaps folder, and get a listing of files using the ls –l command.

* Issue the command below to open the nimda.download.pcap file in Wireshark. (wireshark nimda.download.pcap &)
* The `nimda.download.pcap` file contains the packet capture related to the malware download performed in a previous lab. The pcap contains all the packets sent and received while tcpdump was running. 
* Select the fourth packet in the capture and expand the Hypertext Transfer Protocol to display as shown below.

* Packets one through three are the TCP handshake. The fourth packet shows the request for the malware file. Confirming what was already known, the request was done over HTTP, sent as a GET request
* Because HTTP runs over TCP, it is possible to use Wireshark’s Follow TCP Stream feature to rebuild the TCP transaction. Select the first TCP packet in the capture, a SYN packet. Right-click it and choose `Follow > TCP Stream`
* Wireshark displays another window containing the details for the entire selected TCP flow

* What are all those symbols shown in the Follow TCP Stream window? Are they connection noise? Data? Explain.

      Symbols are the contents of the actual file that downloaded. Binary content is decoded by the wireshark.

* There are a few readable words spread among the symbols. Why are they there?

      The few readable words among the symbols are the strings by which an analyst can extract information from it.

* Challenge Question: Despite the W32.Nimda.Amm.exe name, this executable is not the famous worm. For security reasons, this is another executable file that was renamed as W32.Nimda.Amm.exe. Using the word fragments displayed by Wireshark’s Follow TCP Stream window, can you tell what executable this really is?

      If we scroll through the TCP stream we can find it is a Windows cmd .exe file

* Click Close in the Follow TCP Stream window to return to the Wireshark nimda.download.pcap file.

## Part 2: Extract Downloaded Files from PCAP

* Because capture files contain all packets related to traffic, a PCAP of a download can be used to retrieve a previously downloaded file. Follow the steps below to use Wireshark to retrieve the Nimda malware.
* In that fourth packet in the `nimda.download.pcap` file, notice that the HTTP GET request was generated from `209.165.200.235 to 209.165.202.133`. The Info column also shows this is in fact the GET request for the file
* With the GET request packet selected, navigate to `File > Export Objects > HTTP`, from Wireshark’s menu.
* Wireshark will display all HTTP objects present in the TCP flow that contains the GET request. In this case, only the W32.Nimda.Amm.exe file is present in the capture. It will take a few seconds before the file is displayed.

* Why is W32.Nimda.Amm.exe the only file in the capture?

      No other files are downloaded apart from the W32.Nimda.Amm.exe file.

* In the HTTP object list window, select the `W32.Nimda.Amm.exe` file and click Save As at the bottom of the screen.
* Click the left arrow until you see the Home button. Click Home and then click the analyst folder (not the analyst tab). Save the file there.
* Return to your terminal window and ensure the file was saved. Change directory to the /home/analyst folder and list the files in the folder using the ls -l command.

* The file command gives information on the file type. Use the file command to learn a little more about the malware, as show below:

* As seen above, W32.Nimda.Amm.exe is indeed a Windows executable file.
* In the malware analysis process, what would be a probable next step for a security analyst?

      The application should be kept in sandboxed environment, analyze its behaviour and apply tools such as VirusTotal to check the malware.
