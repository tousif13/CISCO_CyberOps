# 27.2.16 Lab - Investigating an Attack on a Windows Host

## Part 1: Investigate the Attack with Sguil

* In Part 1, you will use Sguil to check the IDS alerts and gather more information about the series of events related to an attack on 3-19-2019.

### Step 1: Open Sguil and locate the alerts on 3-19-2019

* Login to Security Onion VM with the analyst username and cyberops password.
* Launch Sguil from the desktop. Login with username analyst and password cyberops. Click Select All and Start Sguil to view all the alerts generated by the network sensors.
* Locate the group of alerts from 19 March 2019.

* According to Sguil, what are the timestamps for the first and last of the alerts that occurred on 3-19-2019? What is interesting about the timestamps of all the alerts on 3-19-2019?

       01:45:03 to 04:54:34 and most of the alerts came in the span of 3 minutes

### Step 2: Review the alerts in detail.

* In Sguil, click the first of the alerts on 3-19-2019 (Alert ID 5.439). Make sure to check the `Show Packet Data` and `Show Rule` checkboxes to examine the packet header information and the IDS signature rule related to the alert. Right on the Alert ID and pivot to Wireshark. Based on the information derived from 
this initial alert answer the following questions:
* What was the source IP address and port number and destination IP address and port number?

      Source      - 10.0.90.215:52609
      Destination - 10.0.90.9:53

* What type of protocol and request or response was involved?

      UDP protocol
      DNS dynamic update
      DNS dynamic update response

* What is the IDS alert and message?

      alert udp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 53, msg: "ET POLICY DNS Update from External net"

* Do you think this alert was the result of an IDS misconfiguration or a legitimate suspicious communication?

      This alert may be the result of an IDS misconfiguration because the DNS request was a Dynamic DNS update from an internal host to a DNS server on the internal network itself

* What is the hostname, domain name, and IP address of the source host in the DNS update?

      hostname    - Bobby-Tiger-PC
      domain name - littletigers.info
      IP address  - 10.0.90.215

* In Sguil, select the second of the alerts on 3-19-2019. Right click the Alert ID 5.440 and select `Transcript`.

* From the transcript answer the following questions:
* What is the source and destination IP address and port numbers?

      Source      - 10.0.90.215:49204
      Destination - 209.141.34.8:80

* Looking at the request (blue) what was the request for?

      GET /test1.exe HTTP/1.1

* Looking at the reply (red) many files will reveal their file signature in the initial few characters of the filewhen viewed as text. File signatures help identify the type of file that is represented. Use a web browser 
to search for a list of common file signatures.
* What is the initial few characters of the file file. Search for this file signature to find out what type of file was downloaded in the data?

      Initial few characters of the file are MZ and it is a DOS MZ executable and its descendants

* Close the transcript. Use Wireshark to export the executable file for malware analysis (`File > Export Objects > HTTPâ€¦`). Save the file to the analyst's home folder.

* Open a terminal in Security Onion VM and create a SHA256 hash from the exported file. Use the following command:

* Copy the file hash and submit it to the Cisco Talos file reputation center at https://talosintelligence.com/talos_file_reputation.

* Did Talos recognize the file hash and identify it as malware? If so, what kind of malware?

         Talos recognizes the file hash as Trojan malware

* In Sguil select the alert with `Alert ID 5.480` and the `Event Message Remcos RAT Checkin 23`. Notice that the IDS signature has detected the Remcos RAT based on the binary hex codes at the beginning of communication.

* Right click the Alert ID and select Transcript. Scroll through the transcript and answer the following questions:
* What is the destination port of the communication? Is it a well-known port?

         2404 is the destination port of the communication and it's not a well-known port

* Is the communication readable or is it encrypted?

         It is encrypted
  
* Do some online research on Remcos RAT Checkin 23. What does Remcos stand for? 

       Remcos is a sophisticated remote access Trojan (RAT) that can be used to fully control and monitor any Windows computer from XP and onwards. Remcos stand for " Remote Control and Surveillance
       
* What type of communication do you think was being transmitted?

       Seems like key stroke information was being transmitted
  
* What type of encryption and obfuscation was used to bypass detection?

         multiple packers, base64 encoding and RC4 was used to bypass detection

* Using Sguil and the remaining alerts from 3-19-2019, locate the second executable file that was downloaded and check to see if it is known malware. 
* What Alert IDs alert to a second executable file being downloaded?

          5.483, 5.485, 5.497, 5.509, 5.521, 5.533

* From which server IP address and port number was the file downloaded from?

         217.23.14.81 and port 80
  
* What is the name of the file that was downloaded?

         F4.exe

* Create a SHA256 hash of the file and submit the hash online at Cisco Talos File Reputation Center to see if it matches known malware. Is the executable file known malware and if so, what type? What is the AMP DETECTION NAME?

* Examine the remaining three alerts from 3-19-2019 by looking at the header information in Show Packet Data, the IDS signature in Show Rule, and the Alert ID Transcripts.
* How are all three alerts related?

         All three alerts are ET TROJAN ABUSE SSL Blacklist malicious SSL certificate detected alerts

* Even though you have examined all the alerts in Sguil related to an attack on a Windows host on 3-19-2019, there may be additional related information available in Kibana. Close Sguil and launch Kibana from the desktop

## Part 2: Use Kibana to Investigate Alerts

* In Part 2, use Kibana to further investigate the attack on 3-19-2019.

### Step 1: Open Kibana and narrow the timeframe.

* Login to Kibana with the `analyst` username and cyberops `password`.
* Open Kibana `(username analyst and password cyberops)`, click Last 24 Hours and the Absolute time range tab to change the time range to March 1, 2019 to March 31, 2019.
* The `Total Log Count Over Time` timeline will show an event on March 19. Click that event to narrow the focus to the specific time range of the attack

### Step 2: Review the alerts in the narrowed timeframe.

* In the Kibana dashboard scroll down to the `All Sensors - Log Type` visualization. Review both pages and note the variety of log types related to this attack.

       India and Mumbai

* Scroll back to the top of the page and click the Home link under Navigation.
* Earlier we noted log types like bro_http listed in the Home dashboard. You can filter for the various log type but the built-in dashboards will probably have more information. Scroll back to the top of the page and click `HTTP` in dashboard link under Zeek Hunting in Navigation.
* Scroll through the HTTP dashboard taking notice of the information presented and answer the following questions:
* What is the Log Count in the HTTP dashboard? From what countries?

       Log count - 4
       Countries - United States and Netherlands

* What are the URIs for the files that were downloaded?

       /f4.exe
       /ncsi.txt
       /pki/crl/products/CSPCA.crl
       /test1.exe

* Match the `HTTP - URIs` to the `HTTP - Sites` on the dashboard.

       /test1.exe                      - 209.141.34.8
       /f4.exe                         - 217.23.14.81

       /ncsi.txt                       - www.msftncsi.com
  
* What are the CSPCA.crl and ncsi.txt files related to? Use a web browser and a search engine for additional information.
