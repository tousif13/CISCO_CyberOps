# 27.2.14 Lab - Isolate Compromised Host Using 5-Tuple

> The 5-tuple is used by IT administrators to identify requirements for creating an operational and secure 
network environment. The components of the 5-tuple include a source IP address and port number, 
destination IP address and port number, and the protocol in use in the data payload. This is the protocol field 
of the IP packet header

> After the attack, the users no longer have access to the file named confidential.txt. Now you will review the 
logs to determine how the file was compromised

## Part 1: Review Aerts in Sguil

* Launch the Security Onion VM and log in. Log in with the user `analyst` and password `cyberops`
* Open `Sguil` and log in. Click `Select All` to select the interfaces and then Start `SGUIL`.

* Review the events listed in the Event Message column. One of these messages is `GPL ATTACK_RESPONSE id check returned root`. This message indicates that root access may have been 
gained during an attack. The host at 209.165.200.235 returned root access to 209.165.201.17. The alert ID `5.1` is used as an example in this lab

* Select the `Show Packet Data` and `Show Rule` checkboxes to view each alert in more detail

* Right-click the alert ID 5.1 and select `Transcript`
* Review the transcripts for the alert. The transcript displays the transactions between the threat actorsource (SRC) and the target (DST) during the attack. The threat actor is executing Linux commands on 
the target.

* What kind of transactions occurred between the client and the server in this attack?

      The attacker gained root access of the target system and the attacker edited /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd.
  
## Part 2: Pivot to Wireshark

* Select the alert that provided you with the transcript from the previous step. Right-click the alert ID 5.1 and select `Wireshark`. The Wireshark main window displays three views of a packet.

* To view all packets that are assembled in a TCP conversation, right-click any packet and select `Follow > TCP Stream`

* What did you observe? What do the text colors red and blue indicate?

      The red color text are the commands given by the threat actor and blue text are the contents displayed as output in the target terminal.

* The attacker issues the `whoami` command on the target. What does this show about the attacker role on the target computer?

      root user (Attacker has full privileges)

* Scroll through the TCP stream. What kind of data has the threat actor been reading?

      user information

* Exit the TCP stream window. Close Wireshark when you are done reviewing the information provided

## Part 3: Pivot to Kibana

* Return to Sguil. Right-click either the source or destination IP for the alert ID 5.1 and select `Kibana IP Lookup > SrcIP`. Enter username `analyst` and password `cyberops` if prompted by Kibana
* If the time range is the last 24 hours, change it to `June 2020 so June 11` is included in the time range. Use the Absolute tab to change the time range.

* In the displayed results, there is a list of different data types. You were told that the file confidential.txt is no longer accessible. In the Sensors - Sensors and Services (Pie Chart), ftp and ftp-data are present in 
the list, as shown in the figure. We will determine if FTP was used to steal the file.
* Let's filter for bro_ftp. Hover over the empty space next to the count of bro_ftp data types. Select + to filter for only FTP related traffic.

* Scroll down to the All Logs section. There are two entries listed.

  ![image](https://github.com/tousif13/CISCO_CyberOps/assets/33444140/e3fb0478-16f5-4a1e-81c5-d86654c75393)

* What are the source and destination IP addresses and port numbers for the FTP traffic?

      Source      - 192.168.0.11    - 52776
      Destination - 209.165.200.235 - 21

* Expand and review both log entries. In one of these entries, the ftp_argument has an entry of ftp://209.165.200.235/./confidential.txt. Also review the message in the log entry to learn more about this event.
* Within the same log entry, scroll up back to the alert _id field and click the link.

* Review the transcript for the transactions between the attacker and the target. If desired, you can download the pcap and review the traffic using Wireshark.
* What are the user credentials to access the FTP site?

      Username - analyst
      Password - cyberops

* Now that you have verified that the attacker has used FTP to copy the content of the file confidential.txt and then deleted it from the target. So what is the content of the file? Remember one of the services 
listed in the pie chart is ftp_data.
* Navigate to the top of the dashboard. Select `Files` under the Zeek Hunting heading in the left panel, as shown in the figure. This will allow you to review the types of the files that were logged
* What are the different types of files? Look at the MIME Type section of the screen.

    HTTP and FTP_DATA

* Filter for `FTP_DATA` by hovering over the empty space next to the Count for FTP_DATA and click `+`.
* Scroll down to review the filtered results.
* What is the MIME type, source and destination IP address associated with the transfer of the FTP data? When did this transfer occur?

      MIME type   : text/plain
      Source      : 192.168.0.11
      Destination : 209.165.200.235
      and it occured at June 11th 2020, 03:53:09
* In the File logs, expand the entry associated with FTP data. Click the link associated with alert _id.

* What is the text content of the file that was transferred using FTP?

      CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT
      DO NOT SHARE
      This document contains information about the last security breach.

* With all the information has gathered so far, what is your recommendation for stopping further unauthorized access?

      Password should be changed immediately to a much harder one.
