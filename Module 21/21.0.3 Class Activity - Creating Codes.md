# 21.0.3 Class Activity - Creating Codes

> Secret codes have been used for thousands of years. Ancient Greeks and Spartans used a scytale (rhymes 
with Italy) to encode messages. Romans used a Caesar cipher to encrypt messages. A few hundred years 
ago, the French used the Vigen√®re cipher to encode messages. Today, there are many ways that messages 
can be encoded.
There are several encryption algorithms that can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. Virtual Private 
Networks (VPNs) are commonly used to automate the encryption and decryption process.

## Part 1: Search for an online encoding and decoding tool

* There are many different types of encryption algorithms used in modern networks. One of the most secure is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) symmetric encryption algorithm. We will be using this algorithm in our demonstration.
* In a Web browser, search for encrypt decrypt AES online. Several different tools will be listed in the search results
* Explore the different links provided and choose a tool. In our example, we used the tool available from: http://aesencryption.net/

## Part 2: Encrypt a message and email it to your lab partner.

* In this step, each lab partner will encrypt a message and send the encrypted text to the other lab partner.
* Enter a plaintext message of your choice in the text box. The message can be very short or it can be lengthy. Be sure that your lab partner does not see the plaintext message.
* A secret key (i.e., password) is usually required to encrypt a message. The secret key is used along with the encryption algorithm to encrypt the message. Only someone with knowledge of the secret key would be able to decrypt the message.
* Enter a secret key. Some tools may ask you to confirm the password. In our example, we used the `cyberops` secret key.

* Next click on Encrypt
* In the Result of encryption in base64 window, random text is displayed. This is then encrypted message
