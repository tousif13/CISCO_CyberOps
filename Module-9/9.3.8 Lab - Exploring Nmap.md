# 9.3.8 Lab - Exploring Nmap

## Part 1: Exploring Nmap

* Start CyberOps Workstation VM.
* Open a terminal.
* At the terminal prompt, enter `man nmap`

* What is Nmap?

        Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. 

* What is nmap used for?

      It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

* While in the man page, you can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through the pages. You can also press the space bar to forward one page at a time.
* Type /example and press ENTER. This will search for the word example forward through the man page
* In the first instance of example, you see three matches. To move to the next match, press n.

* Look at Example 1.

* What is the nmap command used?

      nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

* Use the search function to answer the following questions.
* What does the switch -A do?

        Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute

* What does the switch -T4 do?

        -T4 for faster execution by prohibiting the dynamic scan delay from exceeding 10 ms for TCP ports. -T4 is recommended for a decent broadband or ethernet connection

## Part 2: Scanning for Open Ports

### Step 1: Scan your localhost.

* If necessary, open a terminal on the VM. At the prompt, enter `nmap -A -T4 localhost`. Depending on your local network and devices, the scan will take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes.

* Which ports and services are opened?

          ftp & ssh

* For each of the open ports, record the software that is providing the services.

          FTP : vsftpd
          SSH : OpenSSH

### Step 2: Scan your network.

*  At the terminal command prompt, enter ip address to determine the IP address and subnet mask for this host. For this example, the IP address for this VM is 10.0.2.15 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0

* Which network does your VM belong to?

       10.11.140.0/19

* To locate other hosts on this LAN, enter nmap -A -T4 network address/prefix. The last octet of the IP address should be replaced with a zero. For example, in the IP address 10.0.2.15, the .15 is the last octet. Therefore, the network address is 10.0.2.0. The /24 is called the prefix and is a shorthand for the netmask 255.255.255.0. If your VM has a different netmask, search the internet for a “CIDR conversion table” to find your prefix. For example, 255.255.0.0 would be /16. The network address 10.0.2.0/24 is used in this example

* How many hosts are up?
  
        3

* From your Nmap results, list the IP addresses of the hosts that are on the same LAN as your VM. List some of the services that are available on the detected hosts.

          10.11.128.1
          10.11.128.11
          10.11.140.195
          Services : ftp & ssh

### Step 3: Scan a remote server

* Open a web browser and navigate to `scanme.nmap.org`. Please read the message posted
* What is the purpose of this site?

          It is used for testing purposes where we are authorized to scan this machine with Nmap or other port scanners.

* At the terminal prompt, enter `nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org`

* Which ports and services are opened?

          port - 22/80/9929/31337  service - tcpwrapped

* Which ports and services are filtered?

          25 - smtp
          135 - msrpc
          139 - netbios-ssn
          514 - shell
          5666 - nrpe
          445 - microsoft-ds
          2006 - invokator

* what is the IP address of the server?

          45.33.32.156

* What is the operating system?

        Linux
          
### Reflection Question

* Nmap is a powerful tool for network exploration and management. How can Nmap help with network security? How can Nmap be used by a threat actor as a nefarious tool?

        Nmap can be used to scan the network either internal or remote server and determine which ports are open and type of information such as OS , version , scripts, traceroute etc. It can be used by security professional to look out for the security needs and threat actor also uses this tool to see the open ports and to determine entry point to attack the network.
