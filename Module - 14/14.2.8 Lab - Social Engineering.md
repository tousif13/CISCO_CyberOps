* What are the three methods used in social engineering to gain access to information?

      The three methods that are used in social engineering to gain access to information are :

      * Electronic access 
      * Physical access
      * Social Media

* What are three examples of social engineering attacks from the first two methods in step 2a?

      Three examples in :

* Why is social networking a social engineering threat?

      Many people online today tend to be way too free in sharing of what they see as
      harmless or benign information. But hackers view this information quite differently;
      especially those whose preferred attack vector is identity theft. And to exacerbate the
      situation, the sharing of personal information is usually encouraged by the social media sites
      themselves. That is their way of knowing how to target an individual for advertising. The
      more a social media site knows about a person’s interests and habits, the more likely they are
      to present advertising that will be enticing and effective and, ultimately, the more revenue
      they will generate. Advertisers want more targeted advertising because targeted advertising
      equates to more revenue per advertising dollar spent.
