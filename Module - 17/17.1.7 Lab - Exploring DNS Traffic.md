# 17.1.7 Lab - Exploring DNS Traffic

> Wireshark is an open source packet capture and analysis tool. Wireshark gives a detailed breakdown of the 
network protocol stack. Wireshark allows you to filter traffic for network troubleshooting, investigate security 
issues, and analyze network protocols. Because Wireshark allows you to view the packet details, it can be 
used as a reconnaissance tool for an attacker

## Part 1: Capture DNS Traffic

### Step 1: Download and install Wireshark.

* Download the latest stable version of Wireshark from www.wireshark.org. Choose the software version you need based on your PC’s architecture and operating system.

### Step 2: Capture DNS traffic.

* Start Wireshark. Select an active interface with traffic for packet capture.
* Clear the DNS cache.
* In Windows, enter ipconfig /flushdns in Command Prompt.

* For the majority of Linux distributions, one of the following utilities is used for DNS caching: Systemd - Resolved, DNSMasq, and NSCD. If your Linux distribution does not use one of the listed utilities, please perform an internet search for the DNS caching utility for your Linux distribution.
* Identify the utility used in your Linux distribution by checking the status:
* `Systemd-Resolved` : `systemctl status systemd-resolved.service`
* `DNSMasq` : `systemctl status dnsmasq.service`
* `NSCD` : `systemctl status nscd.service`
* For the macOS, enter sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder to clear the DNS cache in the Terminal. Perform an internet search for the commands to clear the DNS cache for an older OS.
* At a command prompt or terminal, type `nslookup` enter the interactive mode.
* Enter the domain name of a website. The domain name `www.cisco.com` is used in this example.

* Type exit when finished. Close the command prompt.
* Click Stop capturing packets to stop the Wireshark capture

## Part 2: Explore DNS Query Traffic

*  Observe the traffic captured in the Wireshark Packet List pane. Enter `udp.port == 53` in the filter box and click the arrow (or press enter) to display only DNS packets.

* Select the DNS packet contains `Standard query` and `A www.cisco.com` in the Info column

* In the Packet Details pane, notice this packet has Ethernet II, Internet Protocol Version 4, User Datagram Protocol and Domain Name System (query).
* Expand Ethernet II to view the details. Observe the source and destination fields

* What are the source and destination MAC addresses? Which network interfaces are these MAC addresses associated with?
  
      The source MAC address is associated with the NIC on the PC and the destination MAC address is associated with the default gateway.

* Expand Internet Protocol Version 4. Observe the source and destination IPv4 addresses.

* What are the source and destination IP addresses? Which network interfaces are these IP addresses associated with?

      The source IP address is associated with the NIC on the PC and the destination IP address is associated with the default gateway.
  
* Expand the User Datagram Protocol. Observe the source and destination ports.

* What are the source and destination ports? What is the default DNS port number?

        The source port number is 54921 and the destination port is 53, DNS port number.

* Determine the IP and MAC address of the PC.
* In a Windows command prompt, enter arp –a and ipconfig /all to record the MAC and IP addresses of the PC. For Linux and macOS PC, enter ifconfig or ip address in a terminal.

* Compare the MAC and IP addresses in the Wireshark results to the IP and MAC addresses. What is your observation?

          Captured MAC and IP addresses are same as of ipconfig /all results.
* Expand Domain Name System (query) in the Packet Details pane. Then expand the Flags and Queries.
*  Observe the results. The flag is set to do the query recursively to query for the IP address to `www.cisco.com`.

## Part 3: Explore DNS Response Traffic

*  Select the corresponding response DNS packet has Standard query response and A www.cisco.com in the Info column.

*  What are the source and destination MAC and IP addresses and port numbers? How do they compare to the addresses in the DNS query packets?

        The source MAC, IP, Port numbers of query packet became destination now and destination MAC, IP, Port numbers of query became source now.

* Expand Domain Name System (response). Then expand the Flags, Queries, and Answers

* Can the DNS server do recursive queries?

      Yes, DNS server do recursive queries.

* Observe the CNAME and A records in the Answers details. How do the results compare to nslookup results?

      The results in the Wireshark should be the same as the results from nslookup in the Command Prompt or terminal.

## Reflection

* From the Wireshark results, what else can you learn about the network when you remove the filter?

      Without filters, it displays other packets like TCP and ARP. From these packets we can learn about other network traffic and devices involved and what protocols are used by them with their MAC, IP and Port numbers.

* How can an attacker use Wireshark to compromise your network security?

      An attacker can compromise our network security by using Wireshark to observe the network traffic and can get sensitive information in the packets.
