## Lab - Locating Log Files

## Part 1: Log File Overview

> Log files (also spelled logfiles), are files used by computers to log events. Software programs, background
processes, services, or transactions between services, including the operating system itself, may generate
such events. Log files are dependent on the application that generates them. It is up to the application
developer to conform to log file convention. Software documentation should include information on its log
files.

### Step 1: Web server log file example

* Consider the single log entry below. It was generated by Apache, a popular web server

      [Wed Mar 22 11:23:12.207022 2017] [core:error] [pid 3548:tid 4682351596] [client
      209.165.200.230] File does not exist: /var/www/apache/htdocs/favicon.ico

* The single log entry above represents a web event recorded by Apache. A few pieces of information are important in web transactions, including client IP address, time and details of the transaction. The entry above can be broken down into five main parts:
* `Timestamp`: This part records when the event took place. It is very important that the server clock is correctly synchronized as it allows for accurately cross-referencing and tracing back events.
* `Type`: This is the type of event. In this case, it was an error.
* `PID`: This contains information about the process ID used by Apache at the moment.
* `Client`: This records the IP address of the requesting client.
* `Description`: This contains a description of the event

* Use the cat command below to list a web server sample log file. The sample file is located at /var/log

### Step 2: Operating system log file example

> Any software can keep log files, including the operating system itself. Conventionally, Linux uses the /var/log
directory to stores various log files, including operating system logs. Modern operating systems are complex
pieces of software and therefore use several different files to log events. This section takes a quick look at the
/var/log/messages file.

* Stored under /var/log, the messages file stores various system events. The connection of new USB drive, a network card becoming available, and too many missed root login attempts, are a few examples of events logged to the /var/log/messages file. Use the more command to display the contents of the /var/log/messages file. Unlike the cat command, more allows for a paced navigation through the file. Press ENTER to advance line-by-line or SPACE to advance an entire page. Press q or CTRL + C to abort and exit more.
