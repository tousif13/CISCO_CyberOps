# 10.4.3 Lab - Using Wireshark to Examine TCP and UDP Captures

## Part 1: Identify TCP Header Fields and Operation Using a Wireshark FTP Session Capture

### Step 1: Start a Wireshark capture.

* Start and log into the CyberOps Workstation VM. Open a terminal window and start Wireshark. The ampersand (&) sends the process to the background and allows you to continue to work in the same terminal.
* Start a Wireshark capture for the enp0s3 interface
* Open another terminal window to access an external ftp site. Enter `ftp ftp.cdc.gov` at the prompt. Log into the FTP site for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with user `anonymous` and no password

### Step 2: Download the Readme file.

* Enter the command get Readme to download the file. When the download is complete, enter the 
command quit to exit.

* After the transfer is complete, enter quit to exit ftp.

### Step 3: Stop the Wireshark capture.

### Step 4: View the Wireshark main window

* Wireshark captured many packets during the FTP session to `ftp.cdc.gov`. To limit the amount of data for analysis, apply the filter `tcp and ip.addr == 198.246.117.106` and click `Apply`
* The IP address, `198.246.117.106`, is the address for `ftp.cdc.gov`

### Step 5: Analyze the TCP fields.

* After the TCP filter has been applied, the first three packets (top section) display the sequence of [SYN], [SYN, ACK], and [ACK] which is the TCP three-way handshake.
* TCP is routinely used during a session to control datagram delivery, verify datagram arrival, and manage window size. For each data exchange between the FTP client and FTP server, a new TCP session is started. At the conclusion of the data transfer, the TCP session is closed. When the FTP session is finished, TCP performs an orderly shutdown and termination
* The `TCP source port number` belongs to the TCP session host that opened a connection. The value is normally a random value above 1,023
* The `TCP destination port number` is used to identify the upper layer protocol or application on the remote site. The values in the range 0–1,023 represent the “well-known ports” and are associated with popular services and applications (as described in RFC 1700), such as Telnet, FTP, and HTTP. The combination of the source IP address, source port, destination IP address, and destination port uniquely identifies the session to the sender and receiver.
* The `Sequence number` specifies the number of the last octet in a segment.
* The `Acknowledgment number` specifies the next octet expected by the receiver.
* The `Code bits` have a special meaning in session management and in the treatment of segments. Among interesting values are:
* `ACK` — Acknowledgment of a segment receipt.
* `SYN` — Synchronize, only set when a new TCP session is negotiated during the TCP three-way 
handshake.
* `FIN` — Finish, the request to close the TCP session
* The `Window size` is the value of the sliding window. It determines how many octets can be sent before waiting for an acknowledgment.
* The `Urgent pointer` is only used with an Urgent (URG) flag when the sender needs to send urgent data to the receiver.
* The `Options` has only one option currently, and it is defined as the maximum TCP segment size (optional value).

      Source IP address        - 192.168.59.128
      Destination IP address   - 198.246.117.106
      Source Port Number       - 49794
      Destination Port Number  - 21
      Sequence Number          - 0
      Acknowledgement number   - 0
      Header Length            - 40 bytes
      Window Size              - 65535

* In the second Wireshark filtered capture, the CDC FTP server acknowledges the request from the VM. Note the values of the SYN and ACK bits.

      Source IP address        - 198.246.117.106
      Destination IP address   - 192.168.59.128
      Source Port Number       - 21
      Destination Port Number  - 49794
      Sequence Number          - 0
      Acknowledgement number   - 1
      Header Length            - 24 bytes
      Window Size              - 64240

* In the final stage of the negotiation to establish communications, the VM sends an acknowledgment message to the server. Notice that only the ACK bit is set to 1, and the Sequence number has been incremented to 1.

      Source IP address        - 192.168.59.128
      Destination IP address   - 198.246.117.106
      Source Port Number       - 49794
      Destination Port Number  - 21
      Sequence Number          - 1
      Acknowledgement number   - 1
      Header Length            - 20 bytes
      Window Size              - 65535

* How many other TCP datagrams contained a SYN bit?

      One. The first packet.

* After a TCP session is established, FTP traffic can occur between the PC and FTP server. The FTP client and server communicate with each other, unaware that TCP has control and management over the session
* When the FTP session has finished, the FTP client sends a command to “quit”. The FTP server 
acknowledges the FTP termination with a Response: 221 Goodbye. At this time, the FTP server TCP session sends a TCP datagram to the FTP client, announcing the termination of the TCP ses sion. The FTP client TCP session acknowledges receipt of the termination datagram, then sends its own TCP session termination. When the originator of the TCP termination (the FTP server) receives a duplicate termination, an ACK datagram is sent to acknowledge the termination and the TCP session is closed. This sequence is visible in the diagram and capture below.
* By applying an ftp filter, the entire sequence of the FTP traffic can be examined in Wireshark. Notice the sequence of the events during this FTP session. The username anonymous was used to retrieve the Readme file. After the file transfer completed, the user ended the FTP session.

* Apply the TCP filter again in Wireshark to examine the termination of the TCP session. Four packets are transmitted for the termination of the TCP session. Because TCP connection is full duplex, each direction must terminate independently. Examine the source and destination addresses

## Part 2: Identify UDP Header Fields and Operation Using a Wireshark TFTP Session Capture

### Step 1: Start Mininet and tftpd service.

* Start Mininet. Enter cyberops as the password when prompted.
* `sudo lab.support.files/scripts/cyberops_topo.py`
* Start H1 and H2 at the mininet> prompt
* In the H1 terminal window, start the tftpd server using the provided script `/home/analyst/lab.support.files/scripts/start_tftpd.sh`

### Step 2: Create a file for tftp transfer

* Create a text file at the H1 terminal prompt in the /srv/tftp/ folder.
* `echo "This file contains my tftp data." > /srv/tftp/my_tftp_data`
* Verify that the file has been created with the desired data in the folder
* Because of the security measure f or this particular tftp server, the name of the receiving file needs to exist already. On H2, create a file named my_tftp_data

### Step 3: Capture a TFTP session in Wireshark

* Start Wireshark in H1.
* From the Edit menu, choose Preferences and click the arrow to expand Protocols. Scroll down and select UDP. Click the Validate the UDP checksum if possible check box and click OK

![image](https://github.com/tousif13/CISCO_CyberOps/assets/33444140/58be7142-0a78-40f6-a4d1-867cedded03b)

* Start a Wireshark capture on the interface H1-eth
* Start a tftp session from H2 to the tftp server on H1 and get the file `my_tftp_data`
* ` tftp 10.0.0.11 -c get my_tftp_data`
* Stop the Wireshark capture. Set the filter to tftp and click Apply.

* Detailed UDP information is available in the Wireshark packet details pane. Highlight the first UDP datagram from the host computer and move the mouse pointer to the packet details pane. It may be necessary to adjust the packet details pane and expand the UDP record by clicking the protocol expand box. The expanded UDP datagram should look similar to the diagram below.

      Source IP address          - 10.0.0.12 
      Destination IP address     - 10.0.0.11
      Source port number         - 58034
      Destination port number    - 69
      UDP message length         - 32
      UDP checksum               - 0xf85a

* How does UDP verify datagram integrity?

      Checksum is sent in the UDP datagram, after the UDP packet is received, it recalculates again which will check whether the recalculated checksum value and the sent checksum value matches or not.

* Examine the first frame returned from the tftpd server. Fill in the information about the UDP header:

![image](https://github.com/tousif13/CISCO_CyberOps/assets/33444140/85770c51-ce78-43c8-8612-f00eac265328)

      Source IP address          - 10.0.0.11
      Destination IP address     - 10.0.0.12
      Source port number         - 48605
      Destination port number    - 58034
      UDP message length         - 42
      UDP checksum               - 0x1452

* Notice that the return UDP datagram has a different UDP source port, but this source port is used for the remainder of the TFTP transfer. Because there is no reliable connection, only the original source port used to begin the TFTP session is used to maintain the TFTP transfer
* Also, notice that the UDP Checksum is incorrect. This is most likely caused by UDP checksum offload. You can learn more about why this happens by searching for “UDP checksum offload”.

### Step 4: Clean up

* In this step, you will shut down and clean up Mininet.
* In the terminal that started Mininet, enter `quit` at the prompt.
* At the prompt, enter `sudo mn –c` to clean up the processes started by Mininet.

### Reflection Question

* This lab provided the opportunity to analyze TCP and UDP protocol operations from captured FTP and TFTP sessions. How does TCP manage communication differently than UDP?

      TCP manages communication differently than UDP as TCP is connection oriented, after 3 way handshake only TCP will establish the communication and that provides reliability and guaranteed delivery and ensures connection termination too that both parties are aware of closing the communication whereas in UDP, it is connectionless and faster way but no reliability.
