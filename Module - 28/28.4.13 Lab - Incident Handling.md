# 28.4.13 Lab - Incident Handling

> Computer security incident response has become a vital part of any organization. The process for handling a 
security incident can be complicated and involve many different groups. An organization must have standards 
for responding to incidents in the form of policies, procedures, and checklists. To properly respond to a 
security incident, the security analyst must be trained to understand what to do and must also follow all of the 
guidelines outlined by the organization. There are many resources available to help organizations create and 
maintain a computer incident response handling policy. The NIST Special Publication 800-61r2 is specifically 
cited in the Understanding Cisco Cybersecurity Operations Fundamentals (200-201 CBROPS) exam topics.

## Scenario 1: Worm and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Agent Infestation

* Study the following scenario and discuss and determine the incident response handling questions that should be asked at each stage of the incident response process. Consider the details of the organization and the CSIRC when formulating your questions

> This scenario is about a small, family-owned investment firm. The organization has only one location and less 
than 100 employees. On a Tuesday morning, a new worm is released; it spreads itself through removable 
media, and it can copy itself to open Windows shares. When the worm infects a host, it installs a DDoS agent. 
It was several hours after the worm started to spread before antivirus signatures became available. The
organization had already incurred widespread infections.
The investment firm has hired a small team of security experts who often use the diamond model of security 
incident handling.

### Preparation:

    * What security measures are currently in place to detect and prevent malware infections, especially via removable media?
    * Do we have a documented incident response plan tailored to a small investment firm?
    * Have employees received training on recognizing and reporting potential security incidents like unexpected system behaviors or warnings?
    * Are the antivirus and intrusion detection/prevention systems up-to-date with the latest definitions and patches?
    * Do we have a backup strategy in place, and when was the last backup taken?

### Detection and Analysis:

    * How did the presence of the worm is detected within the network?
    * What are the specific symptoms or indicators that led us to believe we're dealing with a worm infection?
    * Can we determine the initial point of entry for the worm into our network?
    * What are the worm's propagation methods, and which systems or departments seem most affected?
    * Have we identified any communication patterns or command-and-control activities associated with the infected systems?

### Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:

    * What specific methodologies or tools should be prioritized to ensure the complete removal of the worm and any associated DDoS agents from our infected systems?
    * Which immediate measures can be implemented to contain its spread and prevent further infiltration into other network segments or systems?
    * What are the critical steps and timelines required to restore affected systems or data from the most recent clean backups, ensuring minimal disruption to business operations?
    * How can we validate the effectiveness of our eradication efforts while simultaneously implementing robust containment strategies to isolate and mitigate the worm's impact on our network?
    * What protocols or safeguards can be established during the containment phase to facilitate a smoother and more secure recovery process, ensuring the integrity and resilience of our restored systems post-incident?

### Post-Incident Activity:

    * How will we conduct a thorough review and analysis of the incident to identify areas for improvement?
    * Are there any regulatory or compliance considerations we need to address following this incident?
    * How will we communicate the incident's outcomes, findings, and lessons learned to relevant stakeholders, including senior management?
    * Should we consider conducting a tabletop exercise or simulation to test and improve our incident response capabilities?
    * What ongoing monitoring or surveillance measures can we implement to detect and prevent similar incidents in the future?

## Scenario 2: Unauthorized Access to Payroll Records

* Study the following scenario. Discuss and determine the incident response handling questions that should be asked at each stage of the incident response process. Consider the details of the organization and the CSIRC when formulating your questions.

> This scenario is about a mid-sized hospital with multiple satellite offices and medical services. The 
organization has dozens of locations employing more than 5000 employees. Because of the size of the 
organization, they have adopted a CSIRC model with distributed incident response teams. They also have a 
coordinating team that watches over the security operations team and helps them to communicate with each 
other.

> On a Wednesday evening, the organizationâ€™s physical security team receives a call from a payroll 
administrator who saw an unknown person leave her office, run down the hallway, and exit the building. The 
administrator had left her workstation unlocked and unattended for only a few minutes. The payroll program is 
still logged in and on the main menu, as it was when she left it, but the administrator notices that the mouse 
appears to have been moved. The incident response team has been asked to acquire evidence related to the 
incident and to determine what actions were performed.
The security teams practice the kill chain model and they understand how to use the VERIS database. For an 
extra layer of protection, they have partially outsourced staffing to an MSSP for 24/7 monitoring
