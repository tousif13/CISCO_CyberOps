# 21.2.10 Lab - Encrypting and Decrypting Data Using OpenSSL

> OpenSSL is an open source project that provides a robust, commercial-grade, and full-featured toolkit for the 
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols. It is also a general-purpose 
cryptography library. In this lab, you will use OpenSSL to encrypt and decrypt text messages.

## Part 1: Encrypting Messages with OpenSSL

* OpenSSL can be used as a standalone tool for encryption. While many encryption algorithms can be used, this lab focuses on AES. To use AES to encrypt a text file directly from the command line using OpenSSL, follow the steps below

 ### Step 1: Encrypting a Text File

* Log into CyberOPS Workstation VM.
* Open a terminal window
* Because the text file to be encrypted is in the `/home/analyst/lab.support.files/` directory, change to that directory:
* Type the command below to list the contents of the encrypted letter_to_grandma.txt text file on the screen:

* From the same terminal window, issue the command below to encrypt the text file. The command will use AES-256 to encrypt the text file and save the encrypted version as message.enc. OpenSSL will ask for a 
password and for password confirmation. Provide the password as requested and be sure to remember the password.

* Document the password
* When the process is finished, use the cat command again to display the contents of the message.enc file

* Did the contents of the message.enc file display correctly? What does it look like? Explain

      The contents are in gibberish form without making any sense of the original message contents.

* To make the file readable, run the OpenSSL command again, but this time add the -a option. The -a option tells OpenSSL to encode the encrypted message using a different encoding method of Base64 before storing the results in a file.
* Once again, use the cat command to display the contents of the, now re-generated, message.enc file:

* Is message.enc displayed correctly now? Explain.

      Yes. While message.enc is encrypted, it is now correctly displayed because it has been converted from binary to text and encoded with Base64.

* Can you think of a benefit of having message.enc Base64-encoded?

      The encrypted message can now be copied and pasted in an email message, for example

## Part 2: Decrypting Messages with OpenSSL

* With a similar OpenSSL command, it is possible to decrypt message.enc.
* Use the command below to decrypt message.enc

* OpenSSL will ask for the password used to encrypt the file. Enter the same password again.
* When OpenSSL finishes decrypting the message.enc file, it saves the decrypted message in a text file called decrypted_letter.txt. Use the cat display the contents of decrypted_letter.txt:

* Was the letter decrypted correctly?

      Yes, the letter decrpyted correctly

* The command used to decrypt also contains -a option. Can you explain?

      message.enc file is Base64 encoded after the encryption. message.enc must be Base64 decoded before OpenSSL can decrypt it.
