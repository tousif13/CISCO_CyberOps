# 5.1.5 Lab - Tracing a route

> The traceroute (or tracert) tool is often used for network troubleshooting. By showing a list of routers
traversed, it allows the user to identify the path taken to reach a particular destination on the network or
across internetworks. Each router represents a point where one network connects to another network and
through which the data packet was forwarded. The number of routers is known as the number of "hops" the
data traveled from source to destination.

`tracert` for Windows and `traceroute` for Unix command is used.
