# 9.2.6 Lab - Using Wireshark to observe the TCP 3-Way Handshake

## Part 1: Prepare the Hosts to Capture the Traffic

*  Start the CyberOps VM. Log in with username analyst and the password cyberops.
*  Start Mininet.
*  Start host H1 and H4 in Mininet.

        xterm H1
        xterm H4

* Start the web server on H4. (`/home/analyst/lab.support.files/scripts/reg_server_start.sh`)
* For security purposes, you are not able to run Firefox from the root user account. On host H1, use the 
switch user command to switch from the root user to the analyst user account: `su analyst`
*  Start the web browser on H1. This will take a few moments. `firefox &`

*  After the Firefox window opens, start a tcpdump session in the terminal Node: H1 and send the output to 
a file called capture.pcap. With the -v option, you can watch the progress. This capture will stop after 
capturing 50 packets, as it is configured with the option -c 50.

`sudo tcpdump -i H1-eth0 -v -c 50 -w /home/analyst/capture.pcap`

* After the tcpdump starts, quickly navigate to 172.16.0.40 in the Firefox web browser.

## Part 2: Analyze the Packets using Wireshark

### Step 1: Apply a filter to the saved capture

* Press ENTER to see the prompt. Start Wireshark on Node: H1. Click OK when prompted by the warning 
regarding running Wireshark as superuser `wireshark &`
* In Wireshark, click File > Open. Select the saved pcap file located at `/home/analyst/capture.pcap`.
* Apply a tcp filter to the capture.
