# Lab - Windows Task Manager

## Part 1: Working in the Processes tab

* Open a command prompt and a web browser.
* Microsoft Edge is used in this lab; however, any web browser will work. Just substitute your browser name whenever you see Microsoft Edge.
* Right-click the Task bar to open Task Manager. Another way to open the Task Manager is to press CtrlAlt-Delete to access the Windows Security screen and select Task Manager.
* Click More details to see all the processes that are listed in the Processes tab.
* Expand the Windows Command Processor heading.

* There are three categories of processes listed in the Processes tab: Apps, Background processes, and Windows processes.
* The Apps are the applications that you have opened, such as Microsoft Edge, Task Manager, and Windows Command Processor, as shown in the figure above. Other applications that are opened by
the users, such as web browsers and email clients, will also be listed here.
* The Background processes are executed in the background by applications that are currently open.
* The Windows processes are not shown in the figure. Scroll down to view them on your Windows PC. Windows processes are Microsoft Windows services that run in the background.
* Some of the background processes or Windows processes may be associated with foreground processes. For example, if you open a command prompt window, the Console Window Host process will be started in the Windows process section, as shown below.
