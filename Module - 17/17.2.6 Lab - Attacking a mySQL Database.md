# 17.2.6 Lab - Attacking a mySQL Database

> SQL injection attacks allow malicious hackers to type SQL statements in a web site and receive a response 
from the database. This allows attackers to tamper with current data in the database, spoof identities, and 
miscellaneous mischief

## Part 1: Open Wireshark and load the PCAP file

* Start the CyberOps Workstation VM
* Click Applications > CyberOPS > Wireshark on the desktop and browse to the Wireshark application.
* In the Wireshark application, click Open in the middle of the application under Files.
* Browse through the /home/analyst/directory and search for lab.support.files. In the lab.support.files directory and open the SQL_Lab.pcap file.

* The PCAP file opens within Wireshark and displays the captured network traffic. This capture file extends over an 8-minute (441 second) period, the duration of this SQL injection attack
* What are the two IP addresses involved in this SQL injection attack based on the information displayed?

      10.0.2.4 and 10.0.2.15

## Part 2: View the SQL Injection Attack

* Within the Wireshark capture, right-click line 13 and select `Follow > HTTP Stream`. Line 13 was chosen because it is a GET HTTP request. This will be very helpful in following the data stream as the application layers sees it and leads up to the query testing for the SQL injection
* The source traffic is shown in red. The source has sent a GET request to host 10.0.2.15. In blue, the destination device is responding back to the source.

* In the Find field, enter `1=1`. Click Find Next

* The attacker has entered a query (1=1) into a UserID search box on the target 10.0.2.15 to see if the application is vulnerable to SQL injection. Instead of the application responding with a login failure message, it responded with a record from a database. The attacker has verified they can input an SQL command and the database will respond. The search string 1=1 creates an SQL statement that will be always true. In the example, it does not matter what is entered into the field, it will always be true.
* Close the Follow HTTP Stream window.
* Click Clear display filter to display the entire Wireshark conversation.

## Part 3: The SQL Injection Attack continues...

* Within the Wireshark capture, right-click line 19, and click `Follow > HTTP Stream`
* In the `Find` field, enter `1=1`. Click `Find Next`
* The attacker has entered a query (1’ or 1=1 union select database(), user()#) into a UserID search box on the target 10.0.2.15. Instead of the application responding with a login failure message, it responded with the following information:

* The database name is `dvwa` and the database user is `root@localhost`. There are also multiple user accounts being displayed.
* Close the Follow HTTP Stream window
* Click `Clear display filter` to display the entire Wireshark conversation

## Part 4: The SQL Injection Attack provides system information.

* The attacker continues and starts targeting more specific information.
* Within the Wireshark capture, right-click line 22 and select `Follow > HTTP Stream`. In red, the source traffic is shown and is sending the GET request to host 10.0.2.15. In blue, the destination device is responding back to the source
* In the `Find` field, enter `1=1`. Click Find Next
* The attacker has entered a query (1’ or 1=1 union select null, version ()#) into a UserID search box on the target 10.0.2.15 to locate the version identifier. Notice how the version identifier is at the end of the output right before the </pre>.</div> closing HTML code.

* What is the version?

      5.7.12-0

*  Close the Follow HTTP Stream window
*  Click `Clear display filter` to display the entire Wireshark conversation

## Part 5: The SQL Injection Attack and Table Information.

* The attacker knows that there is a large number of SQL tables that are full of information. The attacker attempts to find them.
* Within the Wireshark capture, right-click on line 25 and select `Follow > HTTP Stream`. The source is shown in red. It has sent a GET request to host 10.0.2.15. In blue, the destination device is responding back to the source
* In the `Find` field, enter `users`. Click Find Next.
* The attacker has entered a query (1’or 1=1 union select null, table_name from information_schema.tables#) into a UserID search box on the target 10.0.2.15 to view all the tables in the database. This provides a huge output of many tables, as the attacker specified “null” without any further specifications.

* What would the modified command of (1' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT null, column_name FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.columns WHERE table_name='users') do for the attacker?

      It displays a shorter output filtered by the occurrence of the word “users”.

* Close the Follow HTTP Stream window
* Click Clear display filter to display the entire Wireshark conversation.

## Part 6: The SQL Injection Attack Concludes.

* The attack ends with the best prize of all; password hashes
* Within the Wireshark capture, right-click line 28 and select Follow > HTTP Stream. The source is shown in red. It has sent a GET request to host 10.0.2.15. In blue, the destination device is responding back to the source.
* Click `Find` and type in `1=1`. Search for this entry. When the text is located, click `Cancel` in the Find text search box.
* The attacker has entered a query (1’or 1=1 union select user, password from users#) into a UserID search box on the target 10.0.2.15 to pull usernames and password hashes!

* Which user has the password hash of 8d3533d75ae2c3966d7e0d4fcc69216b?

      1337

* Using a website such as https://crackstation.net/, copy the password hash into the password hash cracker and get cracking. What is the plain-text password?

      charley

* Close the Follow HTTP Stream window. Close any open windows

## Reflection Questions

* What is the risk of having platforms use the SQL langauge?

      Platforms that uses the SQL language are exposed to SQL injection attack.

* Browse the internet and perform a search on “prevent SQL injection attacks”. What are 2 methods or steps that can be taken to prevent SQL injection attacks?

      * We can prevent most instances of SQL injection using parameterized queries instead of string concatenation within the query. These parameterized queries are also know as "prepared statements".

      * Whitelisting permitted input values.
      * Using different logic to deliver the required behavior.
