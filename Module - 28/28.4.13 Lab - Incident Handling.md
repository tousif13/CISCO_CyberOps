# 28.4.13 Lab - Incident Handling

> Computer security incident response has become a vital part of any organization. The process for handling a 
security incident can be complicated and involve many different groups. An organization must have standards 
for responding to incidents in the form of policies, procedures, and checklists. To properly respond to a 
security incident, the security analyst must be trained to understand what to do and must also follow all of the 
guidelines outlined by the organization. There are many resources available to help organizations create and 
maintain a computer incident response handling policy. The NIST Special Publication 800-61r2 is specifically 
cited in the Understanding Cisco Cybersecurity Operations Fundamentals (200-201 CBROPS) exam topics.

## Scenario 1: Worm and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Agent Infestation

* Study the following scenario and discuss and determine the incident response handling questions that should be asked at each stage of the incident response process. Consider the details of the organization and the CSIRC when formulating your questions

> This scenario is about a small, family-owned investment firm. The organization has only one location and less 
than 100 employees. On a Tuesday morning, a new worm is released; it spreads itself through removable 
media, and it can copy itself to open Windows shares. When the worm infects a host, it installs a DDoS agent. 
It was several hours after the worm started to spread before antivirus signatures became available. The
organization had already incurred widespread infections.
The investment firm has hired a small team of security experts who often use the diamond model of security 
incident handling.

### Preparation:

    Organizations will have standards for responding these type of incidents and the protocols, policies to follow at the time of incident. If any violations took place and areas that most likely worm will spread and already got affected. etc.

### Detection and Analysis:

    What is the entry point of the worm and by what medium it got spread?. Whether it's targetting any specific areas or any pattern of its spreading? what indications are causing for the organization to believe that they're attacked?. what patterns or unusual activity going on? etc.

### Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:

    How to approach for this type of incident? What procedures has to be followed to contain this type of attack or prevention of spreading further? What tools are needed to analyze the situation? Who should do what type of work in containment, eradication and recovery parts?. Any traces or evidences of the worm that is spreading etc.

### Post-Incident Activity:

    What are all the preventive measures to be taken? What precautions has to be taken that the incident wont occur again? How to make the detection system to detect efficiently? Analyzing future patterns of the worm and being proactive

## Scenario 2: Unauthorized Access to Payroll Records

* Study the following scenario. Discuss and determine the incident response handling questions that should be asked at each stage of the incident response process. Consider the details of the organization and the CSIRC when formulating your questions.

> This scenario is about a mid-sized hospital with multiple satellite offices and medical services. The 
organization has dozens of locations employing more than 5000 employees. Because of the size of the 
organization, they have adopted a CSIRC model with distributed incident response teams. They also have a 
coordinating team that watches over the security operations team and helps them to communicate with each 
other.

> On a Wednesday evening, the organizationâ€™s physical security team receives a call from a payroll 
administrator who saw an unknown person leave her office, run down the hallway, and exit the building. The 
administrator had left her workstation unlocked and unattended for only a few minutes. The payroll program is 
still logged in and on the main menu, as it was when she left it, but the administrator notices that the mouse 
appears to have been moved. The incident response team has been asked to acquire evidence related to the 
incident and to determine what actions were performed.
The security teams practice the kill chain model and they understand how to use the VERIS database. For an 
extra layer of protection, they have partially outsourced staffing to an MSSP for 24/7 monitoring
