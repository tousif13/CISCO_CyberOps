## Part 1: Examine the Header Fields in an Ethernet II Frame

In Part 1, you will examine the header fields and content in an Ethernet II Frame provided to you. A Wireshark
capture will be used to examine the contents in those fields.

### Step 1: Review the Ethernet II header field descriptions and lengths.

### Step 2: Examine Ethernet frames in a Wireshark capture.

The Wireshark capture below shows the packets generated by a ping being issued from a PC host to its
default gateway. A filter has been applied to Wireshark to view the ARP and ICMP protocols only. The
session begins with an ARP query for the MAC address of the gateway router, followed by four ping requests
and replies.
