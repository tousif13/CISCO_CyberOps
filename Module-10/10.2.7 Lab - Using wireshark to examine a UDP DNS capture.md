## Part 1: Record VM's IP Configuration Information

* In Part 1, you will use commands on your CyberOps Workstation VM to find and record the MAC and IP addresses of your VMâ€™s virtual network interface card (NIC), the IP address of the specified default gateway, and the DNS server IP address specified for the PC. Record this information in the table provided. The information will be used in parts of this lab with packet analysis

* Your CyberOps Workstation VM network settings should be set to bridged adapter. To check your network settings go to: Machine > Settings, select Network, the tab Adapter 1, Attached to: Bridged Adapter.
* Open a terminal in the VM. Enter ifconfig at the prompt to display interface information.

* At the terminal prompt, enter `cat /etc/resolv.conf` to determine the DNS server.

* At the terminal prompt, enter netstat -rn to display the IP routing table to the default gateway IP address.

* The DNS IP address and default gateway IP address are often the same, especially in small 
networks. However, in a business or school network, the addresses would most likely be different.

      IP address                 -   10.11.140.195
      MAC address                -   08:00:27:89:bc:37
      Default gateway IP address -   10.11.128.1
      DNS server IP address      -   10.11.128.1

## Part 2: Use Wireshark to Capture DNS Queries and Responses

In Part 2, you will set up Wireshark to capture DNS query and response packets. This will demonstrate the use of the UDP transport protocol while communicating with a DNS server

* In the terminal window, start Wireshark and click OK when prompted.
