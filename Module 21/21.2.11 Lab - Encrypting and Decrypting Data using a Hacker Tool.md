# 21.2.11 Lab - Encrypting and Decrypting Data using a Hacker Tool

> There may some tools available to recover lost passwords. This is especially true in situations such as this 
where the cybersecurity analyst could acquire pertinent information from the CFO. The pertinent information 
could be the length of the password and an idea of what it could be. Knowing pertinent information 
dramatically helps when attempting to recover passwords. 
Examples of password recovery utilities and programs include hashcat, John the Ripper, Lophtcrack, and 
others. In our scenario, we will use fcrackzip which is a simple Linux utility to recover the passwords of 
encrypted zip files

## Part 1: Create and Encrypt Files

* In this part, you will create a few text files that will be used to created encrypted zip files in the next step

### Step 1: Create text files.

* Start the CyberOps Workstation VM
* Open a terminal window. Verify that you are in the analyst home directory. Otherwise, enter `cd ~` at the terminal prompt
* Create a new folder called Zip-Files using the mkdir Zip-Files command.
* Move into that directory using the cd Zip-Files command.

* Verify that the files have been created, using the ls command.

### Step 2: Zip and encrypt the text files.

* Next, we will create several encrypted zipped files using varying password lengths. To do so, all three text files will be encrypted using the zip utility.
* Create an encrypted zip file called file-1.zip containing the three text files using the following command:
* When prompted for a password, enter a one-character password of your choice. In the example, the letter B was entered. Enter the same letter when prompted to verify.

* Repeat the procedure to create the following 4 other files

      file-2.zip using a 2-character password of your choice. In our example, we used R2.
      file-3.zip using a 3-character password of your choice. In our example, we used 0B1.
      file-4.zip using a 4-character password of your choice. In our example, we used Y0Da.
      file-5.zip using a 5-character password of your choice. In our example, we used C-3P0.

* Verify that all zipped files have been created using the ls -l f* command.

* Attempt to open a zip using an incorrect password as shown.

## Part 2: Recover Encrypted Zip File Passwords

> In this part, you will use the fcrackzip utility to recover lost passwords from encrypted zipped files. Fcrackzip 
searches each zip file given for encrypted files and tries to guess the password using brute-force methods.
The reason we created zip files with varying password lengths was to see if password length influences the 
time it takes to discover a password.

### Step 1: Introduction to fcrackzip

* From the terminal window, enter the fcrackzip –h command to see the associated command options.
* In our examples, we will be using the –v, -u, and -l command options. The -l option will be listed last because it specifies the possible password length. Feel free to experiment with other options.

### Step 2: Recovering Passwords using fcrackzip

* Now attempt to recover the password of the `file-1.zip` file. Recall, that a one-character password was used to encrypt the file. Therefore, use the following `fcrackzip` command:

* How long does it take to discover the password?

        Either one second or less than a second.

* Now attempt to recover the password of the file-2.zip file. Recall, that a two-character password was used to encrypt the file. Therefore, use the following fcrackzip command:

![image](https://github.com/tousif13/CISCO_CyberOps/assets/33444140/c70cac19-05ad-4a04-af12-8dc167b89d8e)

* How long does it take to discover the password?

        About a second

* Repeat the procedure and recover the password of the file-3.zip file. Recall, that a three-character password was used to encrypt the file. Time to see how long it takes to discover a 3-letter password. Use the following fcrackzip command:

![image](https://github.com/tousif13/CISCO_CyberOps/assets/33444140/3a4d1e01-4cdc-4fd3-84b5-39b8e2217919)

* How long does it take to discover the password?

        One second
* How long does it take to crack a password of four characters? Repeat the procedure and recover the password of the file-4.zip file. Time to see how long it takes to discover the password using the following fcrackzip command:

![image](https://github.com/tousif13/CISCO_CyberOps/assets/33444140/44cf9f25-a5da-42b3-a2a5-011f5564c6d3)

* How long does it take to discover the password?

        About 3 seconds

* How long does it take to crack a password of five characters? Repeat the procedure and recover the password of the file-5.zip file. The password length is five characters, so we need to set the -l command option to 1-5. Again, time to see how long it takes to discover the password using the following fcrackzip command:

![image](https://github.com/tousif13/CISCO_CyberOps/assets/33444140/3fed749f-81ff-4904-8ca2-593e77997c1d)

* How long does it take to discover the password?

        1 minute 20 seconds

* Recover a 6 Character Password using fcrackzip
* It appears that longer passwords take more time to discover and therefore, they are more secure. However, a 6 character password would not deter a cybercriminal.
* How long do you think it would take fcrackzip to discover a 6-character password?
* To answer that question, create a file called file-6.zip using a 6-character password of your choice. In our example, we used `JarJar`
* Repeat the procedure to recover the password of the file-6.zip file using the following fcrackzip command


* How long does it take fcrackzip to discover the password?

* The simple truth is that longer passwords are more secure because they take longer to discover.
* How long would you recommend a password needs to be for it to be secure?

        I would recommend password needs to be secure from cracking it about some centuries
