> In a secure production network, network alerts are generated by various types of devices such as security 
appliances, firewalls, IPS devices, routers, switches, servers, and more. The problem is that not all alerts are 
created equally. For example, alerts generated by a server and alerts generated by a firewall will be different 
and vary in content and format.

## Part 1: Preparing the Virtual Environment

* Launch Oracle VirtualBox and change the CyberOps Workstation for Bridged mode, if necessary. Select Machine > Settings > Network. Under Attached To, select Bridged Adapter (or if you are using WiFi with a proxy, you may need NAT adapter) and click OK.
* Launch the CyberOps Workstation VM, open a terminal and configure its network by executing the `configure_as_dhcp.sh` script.

* Use the ifconfig command to verify CyberOps Workstation VM now has an IP address on your local network. You can also test connectivity to a public webserver by pinging www.cisco.com. Use Ctrl+C to stop the pings

## Part 2: Firewall and IDS Logs

> Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are often deployed to partially automate the traffic monitoring 
task. Both firewalls and IDSs match incoming traffic against administrative rules. Firewalls usually compare 
the packet header against a rule set while IDSs often use the packet payload for rule set comparison. 
Because firewalls and IDSs apply the pre-defined rules to different portions of the IP packet, IDS and firewall 
rules have different structures.
While there is a difference in rule structure, some similarities between the components of the rules remain. 
For example, both firewall and IDS rules contain matching components and action components. Actions are 
taken after a match is found.
A common firewall design is to drop packets by default while manually specifying what traffic should be 
allowed. Known as dropping-by-default, this design has the advantage protecting the network from unknown 
protocols and attacks. As part of this design, it is common to log the events of dropped packets since these
are packets that were not explicitly allowed and therefore, infringe on the organizationâ€™s policies. Such events 
should be recorded for future analysis
