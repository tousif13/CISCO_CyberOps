# 17.2.7 Lab - Reading Server Logs

## Part 1: Reading Log Files with Cat, More, Less, and Tail

> Log files are files used to record specific events triggered by applications, services or the operating system itself. Usually stored as plain-text, log files are an indispensable resource for troubleshooting.

 ### Step 1: Opening Log Files.

 > Log files commonly contain plain-text information which can be viewed by practically any program able to 
handle text (text editors, for example). However, because of convenience, usability, and speed, a few tools 
are more commonly used than others. This section focuses on four command-line-based programs: cat, 
more, less, and tail

> cat, derived from the word ‘concatenate’, is a UNIX, command-line-based tool used to read and display the 
contents of a file on the screen. Because of its simplicity and it can open a text file and display it in a text-only 
terminal, cat is widely used to this day

* Start the CyberOps Worstation VM and open a terminal window.
* From the terminal window, issue the command below to display the contents of the `logstash-tutorial.log` file, located in the `/home/analyst/lab.support.files/` folder:
* `cat /home/analyst/lab.support.files/logstash-tutorial.log`

* What is a drawback of using cat with large text files?

      Large text files will have more lines of text which cat command doesn't provide proper page breaking.
* Another popular tool for visualizing log files is `more`. Similar to `cat`, `more` is also a UNIX command-line based tool that can open a text-based file and display the file contents on the screen. The main difference between `cat` and `more` is that `more` supports page breaks, allowing the user to view the contents of a file, 
one page at a time. This can be done using the space bar to display the next page.
* From the same terminal window, use the command below to display the contents of the `logstash-tutorial.log` file again. This time using more:

* The contents of the file should scroll through the terminal window and stop when one page is displayed. Press the space bar to advance to the next page. Press enter to display the next line of text.
* What is the drawback of using more?

      We have to scroll out all the pages and difficult to visit the visited pages again.
  
* Building on the functionality of `cat` and `more`, the `less` tool allows the contents of a file to be displayed page by page, while also allowing the user the choice of viewing previously displayed pages.
* From the same terminal window, use less to display the contents the `logstash-tutorial.log` file again:

* The contents of the file should scroll through the terminal window and stop when one page is displayed. Press the space bar to advance to the next page. Press enter to display the next line of text. Use the up and down arrow keys to move back and forth through the text file.
* Use the “q” key on your keyboard to exit the less tool.
* The tail command displays the end of a text file. By default, tail displays the last ten lines of the file.
* Use tail to display the last ten lines of the /home/analyst/lab.support.files/logstash-tutorial.log file

### Step 2: Actively Following Logs.

* In some situations, it is desirable to monitor log files as log entries are written to the log files. For those cases, 
the tail -f command is very helpful.
* Use `tail -f` to actively monitor the contents of the `/var/log/syslog` file:

![image](https://github.com/tousif13/CISCO_CyberOps/assets/33444140/07a53014-9167-470b-88a6-7175a2b17746)

* What is different in the output of tail and tail -f? Explain.

      The terminal appears does not accept commands further. Because tail is still running, watching the log file and will print any changes written to it on the screen.

* To watch tail –f in action, open a second terminal window. Arrange your display so you can see both terminal windows. Re-size the windows so you can see them both at the same.
* The terminal window on the top is running tail -f to monitor the /home/analyst/lab.support.files/logstash-tutorial.log file. Use the terminal window on the bottom to add information to the monitored file
* To make it easier to visualize, select the top terminal window (the one running tail -f) and press enter a few times. This will add a few lines between the current contents of the file and the new information to be added.
* Select the bottom terminal window and enter the following command:
* `echo "this is a new entry to the monitored log file" >> lab.support.files/logstash-tutorial.log`
* The command above appends the "this is a new entry to the monitored log file" message to the /home/analyst/lab.support.files/logstash-tutorial.log file. Because tail –f is monitoring the file at the moment a line is added to the file. The top window should display the new line in real-time

* Press CTRL + C to stop the execution of tail -f and return to the shell prompt.
* Close one of the two terminal windows

## Part 2: Log Files and Syslog

> Because of their importance, it is common practice to concentrate log files in one monitoring computer. 
Syslog is a system designed to allow devices to send their log files to a centralized server, known as syslog
server. Clients communicate to a syslog server using the syslog protocol. Syslog is commonly deployed and 
supports practically all computer platforms. The CyberOps Workstation VM generates operating system level log files and hands them over to syslog.

* Use the `cat` command as root to list the contents of the `/var/log/syslog.1` file. This file holds the log entries that are generated by the CyberOps Workstation VM operating system and sent to the `syslog` service.

* Why did the cat command have to be executed as root?

      /var/log/syslog file can be accessed by root only. Thus, sudo is given for the root access.

* Notice that the `/var/log/syslog` file only stores the most recent log entries. To keep the syslog file small, the operating system periodically rotates the log files, renaming older log files as syslog.1, syslog.2, and so on.
* Use the cat command to list older syslog files:

* Can you think of a reason why it is so important to keep the time and date of computers correctly synchronized?

      As the logs records the time and date, it is important to keep the time and date of computers correctly synchronized to not make troubleshoot process difficult.

## Part 3: Log Files and Journalctl

> Another popular log management system is known as journal. Managed by the journald daemon, the 
system is designed to centralize the management of logs regardless of where the messages are originating.
In the context of this lab, the most evident feature of the journal system daemon is the use of append-only
binary files serving as its log files.

### Step 1: Running journalctl with no options.

* To look at the journald logs, use the journalctl command. The journalctl tool interprets and displays the log entries previously stored in the journal binary log files.

* Use CTRL+C to exit the display
  
### Step 2: Journalctl and a few options.

* Part of the power of using journalctl lies in its options. For the following commands, use CRTL+C to exit the display
* Use journalctl --utc to display all timestamps in UTC time:

* Use journalctl -b to display log entries recorded during the last boot

* Use journalctl to specify the service and timeframe for log entries. The command below shows all `nginx` service logs recorded today:

* Use the `-k` switch to display only messages generated by the kernel
* Similar to tail -f described above, use the -f switch to actively follow the logs as they are being written:

## Reflection Question

* Compare Syslog and Journald. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?

      Syslog is a way network devices can use a standard message format to communicate with a logging server. It uses plaintext files but has a lack of structure. The information is not centralized. Syslog does not provide a way to separate messages by the related applications. Journald replaced plaintext log files with special file format for log messages. This makes it easier to find relevant log messages.
