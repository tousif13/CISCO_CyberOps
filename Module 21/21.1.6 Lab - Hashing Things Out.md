# 21.1.6 Lab - Hashing Things Out

> Hash functions are mathematical algorithms designed to take data as input and generate a fixed-size, unique 
string of characters, also known as the hash. Designed to be fast, hash functions are very hard to reverse; it 
is very hard to recover the data that created any given hash, based on the hash alone. Another important 
property of hash function is that even the smallest change done to the input data yields a completely different 
hash.
While OpenSSL can be used to generate and compare hashes, other tools are available. Some of these tools 
are also included in this lab.

## Part 1: Hashing a Text File with OpenSSL

* OpenSSL can be used as a standalone tool for hashing. To create a hash of a text file, follow the steps below
* In the CyberOps Workstation virtual machine, open a terminal window.
* Because the text file to hash is in the `/home/analyst/lab.support.files/` directory, change to that directory
* Type the command below to list the contents of the `letter_to_grandma.txt` text file on the screen:

* From the terminal window, issue the command below to hash the text file. The command will use SHA-2-256 as the hashing algorithm to generate a hash of the text file. The hash will be displayed on the screen after OpenSSL has computed it.

* Notice the format of the output. OpenSSL displays the hashing algorithm used, SHA-256, followed by the name of file used as input data. The SHA-256 hash itself is displayed after the equal (‘=’) sign.
* Hash functions are useful for verifying the integrity of the data regardless of whether it is an image, a song, or a simple text file. The smallest change results in a completely different hash. Hashes can be 
calculated before and after transmission, and then compared. If the hashes do not match, then data was modified during transmission
* Let’s modify the letter_to_grandma.txt text file and recalculate the MD5 hash. Issue the command below to open nano, a command-line text editor
* Using nano, change the first sentence from `Hi Grandma` to `Hi Grandpa`. Notice we are changing only one character, `m` to `p`. After the change has been made, press the `<CONTROL+X>` keys to save the 
modified file. Press `Y` to confirm the name and save the file. Press the `<Enter>` key and you will exit out of nano to continue onto the next step.

* Now that the file has been modified and saved, run the same command again to generate a `SHA-2-256` hash of the file

* Is the new hash different that hash calculated in item (d)? How different?
