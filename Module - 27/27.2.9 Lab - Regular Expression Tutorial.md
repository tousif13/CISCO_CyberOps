# 27.2.9 Lab - Regular Expression Tutorial

> A regular expression (regex) is a pattern of symbols that describes data to be matched in a query or other 
operation. Regular expressions are constructed similarly to arithmetic expressions, by using various operators 
to combine smaller expressions. There are two major standards of regular expression, POSIX and Perl.

## Part 1: Complete the regexone.com tutorial.

* Open a web browser and navigate to https://regexone.com/ from your host computer. Regex One is a tutorial that provides you with lessons to learn about regular expression patterns
* After you have finished with the tutorial, record the function of some of the metacharacters that are used in regular expressions.

      $       -  Matches the pattern at ending position
      *       -  Matches zero or more items
      .       -  Matches single item
      [ ]     -  any single character in the list
      \.      -  Period
      \d      -  Matches only digits
      \D      -  Matches non-digits
      ^       -  Matches the pattern at start position
      {m}     -  Matches m no of repetitions
      {n,m}   - n to m range repetitions
      abc|123 - Matches expressions either abc or 123

## Part 2: Describe the provided regular expression pattern.

      ^83            -  Matches any string that begins with the number 83
      [A-Z]{2,4}     -  Matches any string that contains 2 to 4 capital letters consecutively
      2015           -  Matches any string that contains the number 2015
      05:22:2[0-9]   -  Matches any string that contains 05:22:20 to 05:22:29
      \.com          -  Matches any string that contains .com
      complete|GET   -  String that matches complete or GET
      0{4}           -   Matches any string that contains 4 zeroes consecutively

## Part 3: Verify your answers.

* In this step, you will verify your answers in the previous step using a text file stored in the CyberOps Workstation VM.
* Launch and log in to the CyberOps Workstation VM `(username: analyst / password: cyberops)`.
* Open a terminal and navigate to the folder `cd lab.support.files/`
* Use the `less` command to open the `logstash-tutorial.log` file

* At the bottom of the screen, you will see logstash-tutorial.log: highlighted. This is the cursor at which you will enter the regular expression. Precede the regular expression with a forward slash (/). For 
example, the first pattern in the above table is ^83. Enter `/^83`.

* The matching text from the log file is highlighted. Use the scroll wheel on the mouse or use the j or k keys on your keyboard to locate the highlighted patterns
* For the next expression, enter `/[A-Z]{2,4}` at the colon (:) prompt.

* Enter the rest of the regular expressions from the table in Step 2. Make sure all the expressions are preceded with a forward slash (/). Continue until you have verified your answers. Press q to exit the 
logstash-tutorial.log file.
