# 9.2.6 Lab - Using Wireshark to observe the TCP 3-Way Handshake

## Part 1: Prepare the Hosts to Capture the Traffic

*  Start the CyberOps VM. Log in with username analyst and the password cyberops.
*  Start Mininet.
*  Start host H1 and H4 in Mininet.

        xterm H1
        xterm H4

* Start the web server on H4. (`/home/analyst/lab.support.files/scripts/reg_server_start.sh`)
* For security purposes, you are not able to run Firefox from the root user account. On host H1, use the 
switch user command to switch from the root user to the analyst user account: `su analyst`
*  Start the web browser on H1. This will take a few moments. `firefox &`

*  After the Firefox window opens, start a tcpdump session in the terminal Node: H1 and send the output to 
a file called capture.pcap. With the -v option, you can watch the progress. This capture will stop after 
capturing 50 packets, as it is configured with the option -c 50.

`sudo tcpdump -i H1-eth0 -v -c 50 -w /home/analyst/capture.pcap`

* After the tcpdump starts, quickly navigate to 172.16.0.40 in the Firefox web browser.

## Part 2: Analyze the Packets using Wireshark

### Step 1: Apply a filter to the saved capture

* Press ENTER to see the prompt. Start Wireshark on Node: H1. Click OK when prompted by the warning 
regarding running Wireshark as superuser `wireshark &`
* In Wireshark, click File > Open. Select the saved pcap file located at `/home/analyst/capture.pcap`.
* Apply a tcp filter to the capture.

### Step 2: Examine the information within packets including IP addresses, TCP port numbers, and TCP control flags.

* In this example, frame 1 is the start of the three-way handshake between the PC and the server on H4. In the packet list pane (top section of the main window), select the first packet, if necessary.
* Click the arrow to the left of the Transmission Control Protocol in the packet details pane to expand it and examine the TCP information. Locate the source and destination port information.
* Click the arrow to the left of the Flags. A value of 1 means that flag is set. Locate the flag that is set in this packet.

* What is the TCP source port number?

         46288

* How would you classify the source port?

          Dynamic

* What is the TCP destination port number?

          80

* How would you classify the destination port?

          Registered

* Which flag (or flags) is set?

          SYN Flag

* What is the relative sequence number set to?

          0

* Select the next packet in the three-way handshake. In this example, this is frame 2. This is the web server replying to the initial request to start a session.

* What are the values of the source and destination ports?

          80 & 46288

* Which flags are set?

          SYN and ACK flags

* What are the relative sequence and acknowledgment numbers set to?

          0 & 1

* Finally, select the third packet in the three-way handshake.

* Which flag (or flags) is set?

          ACK flag

* The relative sequence and acknowledgment numbers are set to 1 as a starting point. The TCP 
connection is established and communication between the source computer and the web server can 
begin.

## Part 3: View the packets using tcpdump

* Open a new terminal window, enter man tcpdump. Note: You may need to press ENTER to see the prompt.
* What does the switch -r do?

          Read packets from file (which was created with the -w option or by other tools that write pcap or pcap-ng files). Standard input is used if file is ``-''.

* In the same terminal, open the capture file using the following command to view the first 3 TCP packets captured: `tcpdump -r /home/analyst/capture.pcap tcp -c 3`

* Navigate to the terminal used to start Mininet. Terminate the Mininet by entering `quit` in the main CyberOps VM terminal window
* After quitting Mininet, enter `sudo mn -c` to clean up the processes started by Mininet. Enter the password cyberops when prompted.

* There are hundreds of filters available in Wireshark. A large network could have numerous filters and many different types of traffic. List three filters that might be useful to a network administrator.

          TCP , ICMP , HTTP
* What other ways could Wireshark be used in a production network?

          Used for analyzing traffic and to see what type of traffic is coming from which type of ports.
