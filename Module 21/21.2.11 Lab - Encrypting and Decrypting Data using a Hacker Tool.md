# 21.2.11 Lab - Encrypting and Decrypting Data using a Hacker Tool

> There may some tools available to recover lost passwords. This is especially true in situations such as this 
where the cybersecurity analyst could acquire pertinent information from the CFO. The pertinent information 
could be the length of the password and an idea of what it could be. Knowing pertinent information 
dramatically helps when attempting to recover passwords. 
Examples of password recovery utilities and programs include hashcat, John the Ripper, Lophtcrack, and 
others. In our scenario, we will use fcrackzip which is a simple Linux utility to recover the passwords of 
encrypted zip files

## Part 1: Create and Encrypt Files

* In this part, you will create a few text files that will be used to created encrypted zip files in the next step

### Step 1: Create text files.

* Start the CyberOps Workstation VM
* Open a terminal window. Verify that you are in the analyst home directory. Otherwise, enter `cd ~` at the terminal prompt
* Create a new folder called Zip-Files using the mkdir Zip-Files command.
* Move into that directory using the cd Zip-Files command.

* Verify that the files have been created, using the ls command.

### Step 2: Zip and encrypt the text files.

* Next, we will create several encrypted zipped files using varying password lengths. To do so, all three text files will be encrypted using the zip utility.
* Create an encrypted zip file called file-1.zip containing the three text files using the following command:
* When prompted for a password, enter a one-character password of your choice. In the example, the letter B was entered. Enter the same letter when prompted to verify.

* Repeat the procedure to create the following 4 other files

      file-2.zip using a 2-character password of your choice. In our example, we used R2.
      file-3.zip using a 3-character password of your choice. In our example, we used 0B1.
      file-4.zip using a 4-character password of your choice. In our example, we used Y0Da.
      file-5.zip using a 5-character password of your choice. In our example, we used C-3P0.

* Verify that all zipped files have been created using the ls -l f* command.

* Attempt to open a zip using an incorrect password as shown.
