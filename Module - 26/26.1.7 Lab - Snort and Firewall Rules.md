> In a secure production network, network alerts are generated by various types of devices such as security 
appliances, firewalls, IPS devices, routers, switches, servers, and more. The problem is that not all alerts are 
created equally. For example, alerts generated by a server and alerts generated by a firewall will be different 
and vary in content and format.

## Part 1: Preparing the Virtual Environment

* Launch Oracle VirtualBox and change the CyberOps Workstation for Bridged mode, if necessary. Select Machine > Settings > Network. Under Attached To, select Bridged Adapter (or if you are using WiFi with a proxy, you may need NAT adapter) and click OK.
* Launch the CyberOps Workstation VM, open a terminal and configure its network by executing the `configure_as_dhcp.sh` script.

* Use the `ifconfig` command to verify CyberOps Workstation VM now has an IP address on your local network. You can also test connectivity to a public webserver by `pinging www.cisco.com`. Use Ctrl+C to stop the pings

## Part 2: Firewall and IDS Logs

> Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are often deployed to partially automate the traffic monitoring 
task. Both firewalls and IDSs match incoming traffic against administrative rules. Firewalls usually compare 
the packet header against a rule set while IDSs often use the packet payload for rule set comparison. 
Because firewalls and IDSs apply the pre-defined rules to different portions of the IP packet, IDS and firewall 
rules have different structures.
While there is a difference in rule structure, some similarities between the components of the rules remain. 
For example, both firewall and IDS rules contain matching components and action components. Actions are 
taken after a match is found.
A common firewall design is to drop packets by default while manually specifying what traffic should be 
allowed. Known as dropping-by-default, this design has the advantage protecting the network from unknown 
protocols and attacks. As part of this design, it is common to log the events of dropped packets since these
are packets that were not explicitly allowed and therefore, infringe on the organization’s policies. Such events 
should be recorded for future analysis

### Step 1: Real-Time IDS Log Monitoring

* From the CyberOps Workstation VM, run the script to start mininet.

* The mininet prompt should be displayed, indicating mininet is ready for commands.
* From the mininet prompt, open a shell on R1 using the command below:
* The R1 shell opens in a terminal window with black text and white background. What user is logged into that shell? What is the indicator of this?

      Root user as # symbol is the indicator of it.

* From R1’s shell, start the Linux-based IDS, Snort ( `./lab.support.files/scripts/start_snort.sh`)

* From the CyberOps Workstation VM mininet prompt, open shells for hosts H5 and H10. ( `xterm H5 & xterm H10` )
* H10 will simulate a server on the Internet that is hosting malware. On H10, run the `mal_server_start.sh` script to start the server.

* On H10, use `netstat` with the `-tunpa` options to verify that the web server is running. When used as shown below, `netstat` lists all ports currently assigned to services:

* As seen by the output above, the lightweight webserver `nginx` is running and listening to connections on port `TCP 6666`.
* In the R1 terminal window, an instance of Snort is running. To enter more commands on R1, open another R1 terminal by entering the `xterm R1` again in the CyberOps Workstation VM terminal window.You may also want to arrange the terminal windows so that you can see and interact with each device
* In the new R1 terminal tab, run the tail command with the `-f` option to monitor the `/var/log/snort/alert` file in real-time. This file is where snort is configured to record alerts.

* Because no alerts were yet recorded, the log should be empty. However, if you have run this lab before, old alert entries may be shown. In either case, you will not receive a prompt after typing this command. This window will display alerts as they happen
* From `H5`, use the `wget` command to download a file named `W32.Nimda.Amm.exe`. Designed to download content via HTTP, wget is a great tool for downloading files from web servers directly from the command line

* What port is used when communicating with the malware web server? What is the indicator?

      port 6666 as seperated by : after the ip address

* Was the file completely downloaded?

      Yes. 100%

* Did the IDS generate any alerts related to the file download?

      Yes
