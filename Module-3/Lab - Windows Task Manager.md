# Lab - Windows Task Manager

* Open a command prompt and a web browser.
* Microsoft Edge is used in this lab; however, any web browser will work. Just substitute your browser name whenever you see Microsoft Edge.

* Click More details to see all the processes that are listed in the Processes tab.
* Expand the Windows Command Processor heading.
