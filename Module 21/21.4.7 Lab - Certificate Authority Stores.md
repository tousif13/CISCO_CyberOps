## Part 1: Certificates Trusted by Your Browser

> HTTPS relies on a third-party entity for validation. Known as Certification Authority (CA), this third-party entity 
verifies if a domain name really belongs to the organization claiming its ownership. If the verification checks, 
the CA creates a digitally signed certificate containing an information about the organization, including its 
public key.
The entire system is based on the fact that web browsers and operating systems ship with a list of CAs they 
trust. Any certificates signed by any of the CAs in the list will be seen by the browser as legitimate and be 
automatically trusted. To make the system more secure and more scalable, CAs often spread the task of 
creating and signing certificates among many child CAs. The parent CA is known as the Root CA. If a 
browser trusts a Root CA, it also trusts all of its children CAs.
