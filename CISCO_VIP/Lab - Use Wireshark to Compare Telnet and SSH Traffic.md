## Lab - Use Wireshark to Compare Telnet and SSH Traffic

> Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that lets you see whatâ€™s happening on your network at a microscopic
level. You can capture packets and store them for offline analysis. Wireshark includes many tools for deep
inspection of hundreds of network protocols. In this lab, you will use Wireshark to capture and inspect web
traffic, Telnet traffic, and SSH traffic.

### Step 1: Open a terminal window in the CSE-LABVM.

* Launch the CSE-LABVM.
* Double-click the Terminal icon to open a terminal.
