## Part 1: Examine the Header Fields in an Ethernet II Frame

In Part 1, you will examine the header fields and content in an Ethernet II Frame provided to you. A Wireshark
capture will be used to examine the contents in those fields.

### Step 1: Review the Ethernet II header field descriptions and lengths.

### Step 2: Examine Ethernet frames in a Wireshark capture.

The Wireshark capture below shows the packets generated by a ping being issued from a PC host to its
default gateway. A filter has been applied to Wireshark to view the ARP and ICMP protocols only. The
session begins with an ARP query for the MAC address of the gateway router, followed by four ping requests
and replies.

### Step 3: Examine the Ethernet II header contents of an ARP request.

The following table takes the first frame in the Wireshark capture and displays the data in the Ethernet II 
header fields.

### What is significant about the contents of the destination address field?

      Destination address consists of Broadcast values. The destination address may be a broadcast address which contains all ones and it sends a unicast to the source address.

### Why does the PC send out a broadcast ARP prior to sending the first ping request?

      Inorder to ping or trust the other device or component, it has to know about its MAC address. Through ARP broadcast, particular device will respond by sending its MAC address as unicast and thus connection is established.

### What is the MAC address of the source in the first frame?

      f4:8c:50:62:62:6d

### What is the Vendor ID (OUI) of the Source’s NIC?

      IntelCor

### What portion of the MAC address is the OUI?

      The first 3 octets in the MAC address is the Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI)

### What is the Source’s NIC serial number?

      62:62:6d
