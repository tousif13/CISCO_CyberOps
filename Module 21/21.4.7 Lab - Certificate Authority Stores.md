# 21.4.7 Lab - Certificate Authority Stores

## Part 1: Certificates Trusted by Your Browser

> HTTPS relies on a third-party entity for validation. Known as Certification Authority (CA), this third-party entity 
verifies if a domain name really belongs to the organization claiming its ownership. If the verification checks, 
the CA creates a digitally signed certificate containing an information about the organization, including its 
public key.
The entire system is based on the fact that web browsers and operating systems ship with a list of CAs they 
trust. Any certificates signed by any of the CAs in the list will be seen by the browser as legitimate and be 
automatically trusted. To make the system more secure and more scalable, CAs often spread the task of 
creating and signing certificates among many child CAs. The parent CA is known as the Root CA. If a 
browser trusts a Root CA, it also trusts all of its children CAs.

### Step 1: Display the Root Certificates in Chrome

* Open the Chrome web browser on your PC
* Click the three-dot icon on the far right of the address bar to display Chrome’s options. Click `Settings`.
* Scroll down to `Privacy and security` and click More.
* Scroll down and select `Manage certificates`
* In the Certificate window, select `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` tab to show all certificates and certificate authorities trusted by Chrome

### Step 2: Display the Certificates in the CA Store in Firefox.

* Open Firefox and click the Menu icon. The `Menu` icon is located on the far right of the Firefox window, next to the address bar. Click `Preferences`
* Click `Privacy & Security` in the left panel.
* Scroll down to the Security section and click `View Certificates`
* A window opens that shows the certificates and certification authorities trusted by Firefox

## Part 2: Checking for Man-In-Middle

> A common use for hashes is to verify data integrity, but they can also be used to detect HTTPS man-in-themiddle attacks. 
To protect user data, more and more websites are switching to encrypted traffic. Known as HTTPS, sites use 
protocols such as TLS/SSL to encrypt user traffic from end to end. After the traffic is properly encrypted, it is 
very difficult for any party other than the user and the site in question to see the contents of the encrypted 
message. This is good for the users, but it creates a problem for organizations that want to look into that 
traffic. Companies and organizations often choose to peek into employee-generated traffic for monitoring 
purposes. They needed to be able to look into TLS/SSL-encrypted traffic. This is done by using an HTTPS 
proxy.
Web browsers trust the identity of a visited web site if the certificate presented by that web site is signed by 
one of the CAs installed in the browser’s certificate store. To be able to peek into its users’ TLS/SSLencrypted traffic, a company or organization simply adds another CA into the user’s browser list of installed 
CA.

### Step 1: Gathering the correct and unmodified certificate fingerprint.

* The first step is to gather a few site fingerprints. This is important because these will be used for comparison later. The table below contains a few site certificate fingerprints from popular sites

* What are the fingerprints? Why are they important?

      Digital fingerprints, often represented as cryptographic hashes, are unique identifiers generated from digital data. They are used to ensure data integrity that data hasn't been tampered with or corrupted and used for verifying the authenticity of digital signatures on documents.

* Who calculates fingerprints? How to find them?

      The certificate fingerprint is usually calculated by the CA that signs the certificate. After it has been computed, the CA includes it in the certificate itself. The fingerprint can be easily displayed when viewing the certificate.

### Step 2: Gather the certificate fingerprint in use by the CyberOps Workstation VM

> Now that we have the actual fingerprints, it is time to fetch fingerprints from a local host and compare the 
values. If the fingerprints do not match, the certificate in use does NOT belong to the HTTPS site being 
verified, which means there’s an HTTPS proxy in between the host computer and the HTTPS site being 
verified. Matching fingerprints means no HTTPS proxy is in place.

* Use the three piped commands below to fetch the fingerprint for Cisco.com. The line below uses OpenSSL to connect to cisco.com on port 443 (HTTPS), request the certificate and store it on a text file named `cisco.pem`. The output is also shown for context

* Optionally, use the cat command to list the contents of the fetched certificate and stored in the `cisco.pem` text file

* Now that the certificate is saved in the cisco.pem text file, use the command below to extract and display its fingerprint

* What hash algorithm was used by OpenSSL to calculate the fingerprint?

      SHA-1

* Why was that specific algorithm chosen? Does it matter?

      The fingerprints acquired and shown in the table are all SHA-1. Any other algorithm used by OpenSSL when computing the fingerprint would yield a different hash and therefore a different fingerprint, invalidating the test.

### Step 3: Compare the Fingerprints

* Use Table 1 to compare the certificate fingerprint acquired directly from the Cisco HTTPS site with the one acquired from within your network. Recall, fingerprints may change over time

* Do the fingerprints match?
