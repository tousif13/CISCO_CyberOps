# 5.1.5 Lab - Tracing a route

> The traceroute (or tracert) tool is often used for network troubleshooting. By showing a list of routers
traversed, it allows the user to identify the path taken to reach a particular destination on the network or
across internetworks. Each router represents a point where one network connects to another network and
through which the data packet was forwarded. The number of routers is known as the number of "hops" the
data traveled from source to destination.

`tracert` for Windows and `traceroute` for Unix command is used.

## Step 1: Verifying Network Connectivity Using Ping

* Start the CyberOps Workstation VM. Log into the VM with the following credentials:

      Username: analyst
      Password: cyberops
* Open a terminal window in the VM to ping a remote server, such as `www.cisco.com.`

* The first output line displays the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) e2867.dsca.akamaiedge.net. This
is followed by the IP address 184.24.123.103. Cisco hosts the same web content on different servers
throughout the world (known as mirrors). Therefore, depending upon where you are geographically, the
FQDN and the IP address will be different.

## Step 2: Tracing a Route to a Remote Server Using Traceroute

>  CyberOps Workstation VM network settings may need to be set to bridged adapter if you are not
getting any traceroute results. To check your network settings, go to: Machine > Settings, select Network,
the tab Adapter 1, Attached to: Bridged Adapter.

* At the terminal prompt, type `traceroute www.cisco.com`

* If you would like to save the traceroute output to a text file for later review, use the right carat (>) and the desired filename to save the output in the present directory. In this example, the traceroute output is saved in the /home/analyst/cisco.txt file. You can now enter the `cat cisco.txt` command to view the output of the trace stored in the text file.

* Perform and save the traceroute results for one of the following websites. These are the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) websites located in different parts of the world:

## Step 3: Trace a Route to a Remote Server Using Web-Based Traceroute Tool

* Open a web browser in the VM and search for a visual traceroute tool that you can use in the web browser. Try going to the following website: https://gsuite.tools/traceroute

Review the geographical locations of the responding hops. What did you observe regarding the path?

      It does not take same path always

### How is the traceroute different when going to www.cisco.com or other websites from the terminal (see Part 2)
rather than from the online website?

      traceroute in terminal shows the no of hops and their information, while online website also showed visual representation in map.
