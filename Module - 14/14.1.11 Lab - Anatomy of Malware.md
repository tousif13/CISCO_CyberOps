# 14.1.11 Lab - Anatomy of Malware

> Malware, or malicious software, refers to a variety of malicious software programs that can be used to cause
harm to computer systems, steal data, and bypass security measures. Malware can also attack critical
infrastructure, disable emergency services, cause assembly lines to make defective products, disable electric
generators, and disrupt transportation services. Security experts estimate that more than one million new
malware threats are released each day. McAfee Labs Threats Report 2019 indicates the discovery of new
ransomware techniques, the exposing of billions of accounts through high profile data dumps, significant
HTTP web exploitation, defects in Windows, Microsoft Office, and Apple iOS, and continued attacks on IoT
personal devices. Find the most current version of the report by doing a web search for McAfee Labs Threats

## Conduct a Search of Recent Malware

* Using your favorite search engine, conduct a search for recent malware. During your search, choose four examples of malware, each one from a different malware type, and be prepared to discuss details on what each does, how it each is transmitted and the impact each cause
* Examples of malware types include: Ransomware, Trojan, Hoax, Adware, Malware, PUP, Exploit, Exploit Kit and Vulnerability

### Malware : Qbot Malware

    The QBot malware operation has started to abuse a DLL hijacking flaw in the Windows 10 WordPad program to infect computers, using the legitimate program to evade detection by security software. A DLL is a library file containing functions that can be used by more than one program at the same time. When an application is launched, it will attempt to load any required DLLs. It does this by searching through specific Windows folders for the DLL and, when found, loads it. However, Windows applications will prioritize DLLs in the same folder as the executable, loading them before all others.
    
### Ransomware : Akira

    The new Akira ransomware operation has slowly been building a list of victims as they breach corporate networks worldwide, encrypt files, and then demand million-dollar ransoms. Launched in March 2023, Akira claims to have already conducted attacks on sixteen companies. These companies are in various industries, including education, finance, real estate, manufacturing, and consulting. 

### Malware : ReconShark

    The North Korean Kimsuky hacking group has been observed employing a new version of its reconnaissance malware, now called 'ReconShark,' in a cyberespionage campaign with a global reach. Sentinel Labs reports that the threat actor has expanded its targeting scope, now targeting government organizations, research centers, universities, and think tanks in the United States, Europe, and Asia. In March 2023, South Korean and German authorities warned that Kimsuky, also known as Thallium and Velvet Chollima, began spreading malicious Chrome extensions that targeted Gmail accounts and an Android spyware that served as a remote access trojan.

### Malware : MerDoor

    A new APT hacking group dubbed Lancefly uses a custom 'Merdoor' backdoor malware to target government, aviation, and telecommunication organisations in South and Southeast Asia. The Symantec Threat Labs revealed today that Lancefly has been deploying the stealthy Merdoor backdoor in highly targeted attacks since 2018 to establish persistence, execute commands, and perform keylogging on corporate networks. Lancefly is believed to focus on cyber-espionage, aiming to collect intelligence from its victims' networks over extensive periods.

### Akira Ransomware

    The new Akira ransomware operation has slowly been building a list of victims as they breach corporate networks worldwide, encrypt files, and then demand million-dollar ransoms. Launched in March 2023, Akira claims to have already conducted attacks on sixteen companies.

    When executed, Akira will delete Windows Shadow Volume Copies on the device by running the following PowerShell command:

    powershell.exe -Command "Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | Remove-WmiObject"

    The ransomware will then proceed to encrypt files of many popular file extensions. Akira also uses the Windows Restart Manager API to close processes or shut down Windows services that may be keeping a file open and preventing encryption. Each computer folder will contain a ransom note named akira_readme.txt  that includes information on what happened to a victim's files and links to the Akira data leak site and negotiation site.

    At the time of this writing, Akira has leaked the data for four victims on their data leak site, with the size of the leaked data ranging from 5.9 GB for one company to 259 GB for another.

    From negotiations seen by BleepingComputer, the ransomware gang demands ransoms ranging from a $200,000 to millions of dollars.

    They are also willing to lower ransom demands for companies who do not need a decryptor, and just want to prevent the leaking of stolen data.

    The ransomware is currently being analyzed for weaknesses, and BleepingComputer does not advise victims to pay the ransom until its determined if a free decryptor can recover files for free.
